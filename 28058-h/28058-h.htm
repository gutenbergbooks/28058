<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> this little text-book the author has tried
to combine the trade information which
he has gained in his avocation, the study of
precious stones, with the scientific knowledge
bearing thereon, which his vocation, the teaching
of chemistry, has compelled him to master.</p>

<p>In planning and in writing the book, every
effort has been made to teach the fundamental
principles and methods in use for identifying
precious stones, in as natural an order as possible.
This has been done in the belief that the
necessary information will thus be much more
readily acquired by the busy gem merchant
or jeweler than would have been the case had
the material been arranged in the usual systematic
order. The latter is of advantage
for quick reference after the fundamentals of
the subject have been mastered. It is hoped,
however, that the method of presentation used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
in this book will make easy the acquisition of
a knowledge of gemology and that many who
have been deterred from studying the subject
by a feeling that the difficulties due to their lack
of scientific training were insurmountable, will
find that they can learn all the science that is
really necessary, as they proceed. To that end
the discussions have been given in as untechnical
language as possible and homely illustrations
have in many cases been provided.</p>

<p>Nearly every portion of the subject that a
gem merchant needs to know has been considered
and there is provided for the interested
public much material which will enable them
to be more intelligent purchasers of gem-set
jewelry, as well as more appreciative lovers of
Nature's wonderful mineral masterpieces.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Because</span> of the rapid increase in knowledge
about precious stones on the part
of the buying public, it has become necessary
for the gem merchant and his clerks and salesmen
to know at least as much about the subject
of gemology as their better informed customers
are likely to know.</p>

<p>In many recent articles in trade papers,
attention has been called to this need, and to
the provision which Columbia University has
made for a course in the study of gems. The
action of the National Association of Goldsmiths
of Great Britain in providing annual
examinations in gemology, and in granting
certificates and diplomas to those who successfully
pass the examinations, has also been reported,
and it has been suggested that some such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
course should be pursued by jewelers' associations
in this country. The greatest difficulty
in the way of such formal study among our
jewelers and gem merchants is the lack of time
for attendance on formal courses, which must
necessarily be given at definite times and in
definite places.</p>

<p>As a diamond salesman was heard to say
recently: "The boss said he wanted me to take
in that course at Columbia, but he didn't tell
me how I was going to do it. Here I am a
thousand miles from Columbia, and it was only
six weeks ago that he was telling me I ought
to take that course. I can't stay around New
York all the time." Similarly those whose
work keeps them in New York might object
that their hours of employment prevented
attendance on day courses, and that distance
from the university and fatigue prevent
attendance on night courses. The great mass
of gem dealers in other cities must also be
considered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>It will therefore be the endeavor of this book
to provide guidance for those who really want
to make themselves more efficient in the gem
business, but who have felt that they needed
something in the way of suggestion regarding
what to attempt, and how to go about it.</p>

<p>Study of the sort that will be suggested
can be pursued in spare moments, on street
cars or elevated trains, in waiting rooms, or
in one's room at night. It will astonish many
to find how much can be accomplished by
consistently utilizing spare moments. Booker
T. Washington is said to have written in such
spare time practically all that he has published.</p>

<p>For the practical study of the gems themselves,
which is an absolutely essential part of
the work, those actually engaged in the trade
have better opportunities than any school
could give and, except during rush seasons, there
is plenty of time during business hours for such
study. No intelligent employer will begrudge
such use of time for which he is paying, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
thing be done in reason and with a serious view
to improvement. The frequent application
of what is acquired, as opportunity offers, in
connection with ordinary salesmanship, will help
fix the subject and at the same time increase
sales.</p>

<p>Many gem dealers have been deterred from
beginning a study of gems because of the seeming
difficulties in connection with the scientific
determination of the different varieties of stones.
Now science is nothing but boiled-down common
sense, and a bold front will soon convince
one that most of the difficulties are more apparent
than real. Such minor difficulties as
exist will be approached in such a manner
that a little effort will overcome them. For
those who are willing to do more work, this
book will suggest definite portions of particular
books, which are easily available, for reference
reading and study&mdash;but the lessons themselves
will attempt to teach the essential things in as
simple a manner as is possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the first essential for the gem merchant
is to be able surely to distinguish the
various stones from one another and from
synthetic and imitation stones.</p>

<p>That such ability is much needed will be
clear to anyone who in casting a backward
glance over his experience recalls the many
serious mistakes that have come to his knowledge.
Many more have doubtless occurred
without detection. Several times recently the
author has come across cases where large
dealers have been mistaken in their determination
of colored stones, particularly emeralds.
Only the other day a ring was brought to me
that had been bought for a genuine emerald
ring after the buyer had taken it to one of the
dealers in his city and had paid for an examination
of it, which had resulted in its being declared
genuine. On examining the stone with
a lens of only moderate power, several round
air bubbles were noted in it, and on barely
touching it with a file it was easily scratched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
The material was green glass. Now, what was
said about the dealer who sold it and the one
who appraised it may be imagined. The long
chain of adverse influence which will be put
in action against those dealers, even though
the one who sold the stone makes good the loss,
is something that can be ill afforded by any
dealer, and all this might have been avoided
by even a rudimentary knowledge of the means
of distinguishing precious stones. The dealer
was doubtless honest, but, through carelessness
or ignorance, was himself deceived.</p>

<p>Our first few lessons will therefore be concerned
chiefly with learning the best means of
telling the different stones from one another.</p>

<h1>A Text-Book of Precious Stones</h1>

<h2>LESSON I</h2>
<h3>HOW STONES ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER</h3>

<p><b>Precious Stones Distinguished by their <i>Properties</i>.</b>
One precious stone is best distinguished
from another just as substances of
other types are distinguished, that is to say,
by their <i>properties</i>. For example, salt and
sugar are both <i>white</i>, both are <i>soluble in water</i>,
and both are <i>odorless</i>. So far the italicized
properties would not serve to distinguish the
two substances. But sugar is <i>sweet</i> while salt
is <i>salty</i> in taste. Here we have a distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
property. Now, just as salt and sugar have
properties, so have all <i>precious stones</i>, and while,
as was the case with salt and sugar, many
precious stones have properties in common, yet
each has also some properties which are distinctive,
and which can be relied upon as differentiating
the particular stone from other stones.
In selecting properties for use in distinguishing
precious stones, such properties as can be determined
by quantity, and set down in numbers,
are probably more trustworthy than those
that can be observed by mere inspection.
Those also which have to do with the behavior
of light in passing through the stone are
extremely valuable.</p>

<p><b>Importance of Numerical Properties.</b> It is
because gem dealers so often rely upon the more
obvious sort of property, such as color, that
they so frequently make mistakes. There
may be several different types of stones of a
given color, but each will be found to have
its own numerical properties such as density,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
hardness, refractive power, dispersive power,
etc., and it is only by an accurate determination
of two or three of these that one can be
sure what stone he has in hand. It must next
be our task to find exactly what is meant by
each of these numerical properties, and how one
may determine each with ease and exactness.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="LESSON_II" id="LESSON_II"></a>LESSON II</h2>
<h3>REFRACTION</h3>

<p><b>Explanation of Refraction.</b> Perhaps the
surest single method of distinguishing precious
stones is to find out the <i>refractive index</i> of the
material. To one not acquainted with the
science of physics this calls for some explanation.
The term <i>refraction</i> is used to describe
the bending which light undergoes when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
passes (at any angle but a right angle) from
one transparent medium to another. For
example, when light passes from air into water,
its path is bent at the surface of the water and
it takes a new direction within the water. (See
<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>.)</p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 317px;"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a>
<img src="images/002.png" width="317" height="253" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.</div>

<p>AB represents the path of light in the air
and BC its path in the water.</p>

<p>While every gem stone refracts light which
enters it from the air, <i>each stone has its own
definite ability to do this, and each differs from
every other in the amount of bending which it can
bring about under given conditions</i>. The accurate
determination of the amount of bending
in a given case requires very finely constructed
optical instruments and also a knowledge of
how to apply a certain amount of mathematics.
However, all this part of the work has already
been done by competent scientists, and tables
have been prepared by them, in which the
values for each material are put down.</p>

<p><b>The Herbert-Smith Refractometer.</b> There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
on the market an instrument called the Herbert-Smith
refractometer, by means of which anyone
with a little practice can read at once on the
scale within the instrument the <i>refractive index</i>,
as it is called, of any precious stone that is not
too highly refractive. (Its upper limit is 1.80.
This would exclude very few stones of importance,
<i>i. e.</i>, zircon, diamond, sphene, and
demantoid garnet.)</p>

<p>Those readers who wish to make a more
intensive study of the construction and use of
the refractometer will find a very full and
complete account of the subject in <i>Gem-Stones
and their Distinctive Characters</i>, by G. F.
Herbert-Smith, New York; James Pott &amp; Co.,
1912. Chapter IV., pp. 21-36. The Herbert-Smith
refractometer is there described fully,
its principle is explained and directions for
using it are given. The price of the refractometer
is necessarily so high (duty included)
that its purchase might not be justified in the
case of the smaller retailer. Every large dealer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in colored stones, whether importer, wholesaler,
or retailer, should have one, as by its use
very rapid and very accurate determinations of
stones may be made, and its use is not confined
to unmounted stones, for any stone whose
table facet can be applied to the surface of the
lens in the instrument can be determined.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="LESSON_III" id="LESSON_III"></a>LESSON III</h2>
<h3>DOUBLE REFRACTION</h3>

<p><b>Explanation of Double Refraction.</b> In <a href="#LESSON_II">Lesson
II.</a> we learned what is meant by <i>refraction</i>
of light. While glass and a small number of
precious stones (diamond, garnet, and spinel)
bend light as was illustrated in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>, practically
all the other stones cause a beam of light
on entering them to separate, and the path of
the light in the stone becomes double, as shown
in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>This behavior is called <i>double refraction</i>. It
may be used to distinguish those stones which
are doubly refracting from those which are not.
For example, in the case of a stone which is
doubly refracting to a strong degree, such as
a peridot (the lighter yellowish-green chrysolite
is the same material and behaves similarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
toward light), the separation of the light is so
marked that the edges of the rear facets, as
seen through the table, appear <i>double</i> when
viewed through a lens. A zircon will also
similarly separate light and its rear facets also
appear double-lined as seen with a lens from
the table of the stone. The rarer stones,
sphene and epidote, likewise exhibit this property
markedly. Some colorless zircons, when
well cut, so closely resemble diamonds that
even an expert might be deceived, if caught off
his guard, but this simple test of looking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the doubled lines at the back of the stone would
alone serve to distinguish the two stones.</p>

<p><b>A Simple but very Valuable Test for the
Kind of Refraction of a Cut Stone.</b> In the
case of most of the other doubly refracting
stones the degree of separation is much less
than in peridot and zircon, and it takes a well-trained
and careful eye to detect the doubling
of the lines. Here a very simple device will
serve to assist the eye in determining whether
a cut stone is singly or doubly refracting.
Expose the stone to direct sunlight and hold
an opaque white card a few inches from the
stone, in the direction of the sun, so as to get
the bright reflections <i>from within the stone</i>
reflected onto the card.</p>

<p>If the material is singly refractive (as in the
case of diamond, garnet, spinel, and glass),
<i>single images</i> of each of the reflecting facets
will appear on the card, but if doubly refracting&mdash;even
if slightly so&mdash;<i>double images</i> will
appear. When the stone is slightly moved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
these pairs of reflections will travel <i>together as
pairs</i> and not tend to separate. The space
between the two members of each pair of reflections
serves to give a rough idea of the degree
of the double refraction of the material if compared
with the space between members in the
case of some other kind of stone held at the
same distance from the card. Thus zircon
separates the reflections widely. Aquamarine,
which is feebly doubly refracting, separates
them but slightly.</p>

<p>It will be seen at once that we have here a
very easily applied test and one that requires
no costly apparatus. It is, furthermore, a
sure test, after a little practice. For example,
if one has something that looks like a fine
emerald, but that may be glass, all one need to
do is to expose it in the sun, as above indicated.
If real emerald, double images will be had (very
close together, because emerald is but feebly
doubly refracting). If glass, the images on
the card will be single.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly, ruby can at once be distinguished
from even the finest garnet or ruby spinel, as
the last two are singly refracting. So, too, are
glass imitations of ruby and ruby doublets
(which consist of glass and garnet). This test
cannot injure the stone, it may be applied to
mounted stones, and it is reliable. For stones
of very deep color this test may fail for lack
of sufficiently brilliant reflections. In such a
case hold the card <i>beyond</i> the stone and let
the sunlight shine <i>through</i> the stone onto the
card, observing whether the spots of light are
single or double.</p>

<p>The table below gives the necessary information
as to which stones show double and which
single refraction.</p>

<p>The student should now put into practice
the methods suggested in this lesson. Look
first for the visible doubling of the lines of the
back facets in peridot (or chrysolite); then in
zircon; then in some of the less strongly doubly
refracting stones; then try the sunlight-card
method with genuine stones and with doublets
and imitations until you can tell every time
whether you are dealing with singly or doubly
refracting material. When a stone of unknown
identity comes along, try the method on it
and thus assign it as a first step to one or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
other class. Other tests will then be necessary
to definitely place it.</p>

<p><b>Differences in Refraction Due to Crystal
Form.</b> The difference in behavior toward light
of the singly and doubly refracting minerals depends
upon the crystal structure of the mineral.
All gems whose crystals belong in the cubic system
are singly refracting in all directions: In
the case of some other systems of crystals the material
may be singly refracting in one or in two
directions, but doubly refracting in other directions.
No attention need be paid to these
complications, however, when using the sunlight-card
method with a cut stone, for in such a case
the light in its course within the stone will have
crossed the material in two or more directions, and
the separation and consequent doubling of image
will be sure to result. For those who wish to
study double refraction more in detail, Chapter
VI., pages 40-52, of G. F. Herbert-Smith's <i>Gem-Stones</i>
will serve admirably as a text. As an alternative
any text-book on physics will answer.</p>

<h2>LESSON IV</h2>
<h3>ABSORPTION AND DICHROISM</h3>

<p><b>Cause of Color in Minerals.</b> In <a href="#LESSON_III">Lesson III.</a>
we saw that many gem materials cause light
that enters them to divide and take two paths
within the material. Now all transparent
materials <i>absorb</i> light more or less; that is,
they stop part of it, perhaps converting it into
heat, and less light emerges than entered the
stone. If light of all the rainbow colors (red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) is equally
absorbed, so that there is the same relative
amount of each in the light that comes out as
in the light that went into a stone, we say that
the stone is a <i>white</i> stone; that is, it is not a
<i>colored</i> stone. If, however, only blue light
succeeds in getting through, the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
white light that entered being absorbed within,
we say that we have a blue stone.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <i>color</i> of any transparent
material depends upon its relative degree of
absorption of each of the colors in white light.
That color which emerges most successfully
gives its name to the color of the stone. Thus
a ruby is red because red light succeeds in
passing through the material much better than
light of any other color.</p>

<p><b>Unequal Absorption Causes Dichroism.</b> All
that has been said so far applies equally well to
both singly and doubly refracting materials, but
in the latter sort it is frequently the case,
in those directions in which light always divides,
that the absorption is not equal in the two beams
of light (one is called the ordinary ray and the
other the extraordinary ray).</p>

<p>For example, in the case of a crystal of ruby,
if white light starts to <i>cross</i> the crystal, it not
only divides into an ordinary ray and an extraordinary
ray, but the absorption is different in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the two cases, and the two rays emerge of
different shades of red. With most rubies one
ray emerges purplish red, the other yellowish red.</p>

<p>It will at once be seen that if the human eye
could distinguish between the two rays, we
would have here a splendid method of determining
many precious stones. Unfortunately,
the eye does not analyze light, but rather
blends the effect so that the unaided eye gives
but a poor means of telling whether or not a
stone exhibits twin colors, or <i>dichroism</i>, as it
is called. (The term signifies two colors.)
A well-trained eye can, however, by viewing
a stone in several different positions, note the
difference in shade of color caused by the
differential absorption.</p>

<p><b>The Dichroscope.</b> Now, thanks to the scientific
workers, there has been devised a relatively
simple and comparatively inexpensive
instrument called the <i>dichroscope</i>, which enables
one to tell almost at a glance whether a stone is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
or is not dichroic. The construction is indicated
in the accompanying drawing and description.</p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 178px;"><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a>
<img src="images/004.png" width="178" height="245" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">The Dichroscope.</span></div>

<p>If the observer looks through the lens (A)
toward a bright light, as, for example, the sky,
he apparently sees two square holes, <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 450px;">
<div class="figl">
<img src="images/005.png" width="322" height="97" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.<br />
<small>A, simple lens; B, piece of Iceland spar with
glass prisms on ends to square them
up; C, square hole.</small></div>

<div class="figr">
<img src="images/006.png" width="84" height="84" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.</div></div>

<p class="clr"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>What has happened is that the light passing
through the square hole (C of <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) has
divided in passing through the strongly doubly
refracting Iceland spar (B of <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) and two
images of the square hole are thus produced.</p>

<p>If now a stone that exhibits dichroism is held
in front of the square hole and viewed toward
the light, two images of the stone are seen,
one due to its ordinary ray (which, as was said
above, will have one color), and the other due
to its extraordinary ray (which will have a
different color or shade of color), thus the
color of the two squares will be different.</p>

<p>With a singly refracting mineral, or with
glass, or with a doubly refracting mineral when
viewed in certain directions of the crystal
(which do not yield double refraction) the
colors will be alike in the two squares. Thus
to determine whether a red stone is or is not a
ruby (it might be a garnet or glass or a doublet,
all of which are singly refracting and hence can
show no dichroism), hold the stone before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hole in the dichroscope and note whether or
not it produces twin colors. If there seems to
be no difference of shade turn the stone about,
as it may have accidentally been placed so
that it was viewed along its direction of single
refraction. If there is still no dichroism it is
not a ruby. (<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Scientific rubies exhibit
dichroism as well as natural ones, so this test
will not distinguish them.)</p>

<p>A dichroscope may be had for from seven to
ten dollars, according to the make, and everyone
who deals in colored stones should own
and use one.</p>

<p>Not all stones that are doubly refracting
exhibit dichroism. White stones of course
cannot exhibit it even though doubly refracting,
and some colored stones, though strongly
doubly refracting, do not exhibit any noticeable
dichroism. The zircon, for example, is strongly
doubly refracting, but shows hardly any dichroism.</p>

<p>The test is most useful for emerald, ruby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sapphire, tourmaline, kunzite and alexandrite,
all of which show marked dichroism.</p>

<p>It is of little use to give here the twin colors
in each case as the shades differ with different
specimens, according to their depth and type
of color. The deeper tinted stones of any
species show the effect more markedly than
the lighter ones.</p>

<p>The method is rapid and easy&mdash;it can be
applied to mounted stones as well as to loose
ones, and it cannot injure a stone. The student
should, if possible, obtain the use of a dichroscope
and practice with it on all sorts of stones.
He should especially become expert in distinguishing
between rubies, sapphires, and emeralds,
and their imitations. The only imitation
(scientific rubies and sapphires are not here
classed as imitations), which is at all likely to
deceive one who knows how to use the dichroscope
is the emerald triplet, made with real
(but pale) beryl above and below, with a thin
strip of green glass between. As beryl is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
doubly refracting to a small degree, and dichroic,
one might perhaps be deceived by such an
imitation if not careful. However, the amount
of dichroism would be less in such a case than
in a true emerald of as deep a color.</p>

of dichroism should see <i>Gem-Stones</i>, by G. F.
Herbert-Smith, Chapter VII., pp. 53-59, or see
<i>A Handbook of Precious Stones</i>, by M. D.
Rothschild, Putnam's, pp. 14-16.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_V" id="LESSON_V"></a>LESSON V</h2>
<h3>SPECIFIC GRAVITY</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> properties so far considered as serving
to distinguish precious stones have all
depended upon the behavior of the material
toward light.</p>

<p>These properties were considered first because
they afford, to those acquainted with
their use, very rapid and sure means of classifying
precious stones.</p>

<p><b>Density of Minerals.</b> We will next consider
an equally certain test, which, however, requires
rather more time, apparatus, and skill
to apply.</p>

<p>Each kind of precious stone has its own <i>density</i>.
That is, if pieces of <i>different</i> stones were
taken all of the same size, the <i>weights</i> would
differ, but like-sized pieces of one and the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
material always have the same weight. It is
the custom among scientists to compare the
densities of substances with the density of
water. The number which expresses the relation
between the density of any substance and
the density of water is called the <i>specific gravity</i>
number of the substance. For example, if,
size for size, a material, say diamond, is 3.51
times as heavy as water, its <i>specific gravity</i> is
3.51. It will be seen that since each substance
always has, when pure, the same <i>specific gravity</i>,
we have here a means of distinguishing precious
stones. It is very seldom, if ever, the case that
we find any two precious stones of the same
specific gravity. A few stones have nearly
the same specific gravities, and in such cases
it is well to apply other tests also. <i>In fact
one should always make sure of a stone by seeing
that two or three different tests point to the same
species.</i></p>

<p>We must next find out how to determine the
specific gravity of a precious stone. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
shape of a stone were such that the volume
could be readily calculated, then one could
easily compare the weight with the volume or
with the weight of the same volume of water,
and thus get the specific gravity (for a specific
gravity number really tells how much heavier
a piece of material is than the same volume of
water).</p>

<p>Unfortunately the form of most precious
stones is such that it would be very difficult
to calculate the volume from the measurements,
and the latter would be hard to make accurately
with small stones. To avoid these difficulties
the following ingenious method has been devised:</p>

<p>If a stone is dropped into water it pushes
aside, or <i>displaces</i>, a body of water exactly
equal in volume to itself. If the water thus
displaced were caught and weighed, and the
weight of the stone then divided by the weight
of the water displaced, we would have the
specific gravity number of the stone.</p>

<p>This is precisely what is done in getting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
specific gravity of small stones. To make sure
of getting an accurate result for the weight of
water displaced the following apparatus is used.</p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 137px;"><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a>
<img src="images/007.png" width="137" height="267" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.</div>

<div class="bk1"><p class="td6">A, Flask-like Bottle; B, Indicates Ground Glass Stopper;<br />
C, Shows Hole Drilled through Stopper.</p></div>

<p><b>The Specific Gravity Bottle.</b> A small flask-like
bottle (see <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>) is obtained. This has
a tightly fitting <i>ground</i> glass stopper (B). The
stopper has a small hole (C) drilled through it
lengthwise. If the bottle is filled with water,
and the stopper dropped in and tightened, water
will squirt out through the small hole in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
stopper. On wiping off stopper and bottle we
have the bottle <i>exactly full</i> of water. If now the
stopper is removed, the stone to be tested (which
must of course be smaller than the neck of the
bottle) dropped in, and the stopper replaced,
exactly as much water will squirt out as is equal
in volume to the stone that was dropped in.</p>

<p>If we had weighed the full bottle with the
stone <i>on the pan beside it</i>, and then weighed the
bottle with the stone <i>inside it</i> we could now,
by subtracting the last weight from the first,
find out how much the water, that was displaced,
weighed. This is precisely the thing to do.
The weight of the stone being known we now
have merely to divide the weight of the stone
by the weight of the displaced water, and we
have the specific gravity number. Reference
to a table of specific gravities of precious stones
will enable us to name our stone. Such a
table follows this lesson.</p>

<p><b>A Sample Calculation.</b> The actual performance
of the operation, if one is skilled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
weighing, takes less time than it would to read
this description. At first one will be slow, and
perhaps one should read and re-read this
lesson, making sure that all the ideas are clear
before trying to put them in practice.</p>

<p>A sample calculation may help make the
matter clearer, so one is appended:</p>

<div class="td6">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td8">Weight of bottle + stone (outside)</td><td class="td7">=</td><td class="td7">53.51</td><td class="td7">carats</td></tr>
<tr><td class="td8">Weight of bottle + stone (inside)</td><td class="td7">=</td><td class="td9">52.51</td><td class="td9">carats</td></tr>
<tr><td class="td8">Weight of water displaced</td><td class="td7">=</td><td class="td9">1.00</td><td class="td9">carat</td></tr>
<tr><td class="td8">Weight of stone</td><td class="td7">=</td><td class="td9">3.51</td><td class="td9">carats</td></tr>

<tr><td class="td6">Weight of water</td><td class="td7">1.00</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In this case the specific gravity being 3.51,
the stone is probably diamond (see table), but
might be precious topaz, which has nearly the
same specific gravity.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the jeweler will weigh in
carats, and that his balance is sensitive to .01
carat. With such a balance, and a specific
gravity bottle (which any scientific supply house
will furnish for less than $1) results sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
accurate for the determination of precious
stones may be had if one is careful to exclude
air bubbles from the bottle, and to wipe the
outside of the bottle perfectly dry before each
weighing. The bottle should never be held in
the warm hands, or it will act like a thermometer
and expand the water up the narrow tube
in the stopper, thus leading to error. A handkerchief
may be used to grasp the bottle.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_VI" id="LESSON_VI"></a>LESSON VI</h2>
<h3>SPECIFIC GRAVITY DETERMINATIONS</h3>

<p><b>Weighing a Gem in Water.</b> In the previous
lesson it was seen that the identity of a precious
stone may be found by determining its specific
gravity, which is a number that tells how much
heavier the material is than a like volume of
water. It was not explained, however, how
one would proceed to get the specific gravity of
a stone too large to go in the neck of a specific
gravity bottle. In the latter case we resort
to another method of finding how much a like
volume of water weighs. If the stone, instead
of being dropped into a perfectly full bottle of
water (which then overflows), be dropped into
a partly filled glass or small beaker of water,
just as much water will be displaced as though
the vessel were full, and it will be displaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<i>upward</i> as before, for lack of any other place
to go. Consequently its weight will tend to
buoy up or float the stone by trying to get
back under it, and the stone when in water
will weigh less than when in air. Anyone who
has ever pulled up a small anchor when out
fishing from a boat will recognize at once that
this is the case, and that as the anchor emerges
from the water it seems to suddenly grow
heavier. Not only does the stone weigh less
when in the water, but it weighs exactly as
much less as the weight of the water that was
displaced by the stone (which has a volume
equal to the volume of the stone). If we weigh
a stone first in the air, as usual, and then in
water (where it weighs less), and then subtract
the weight in water from the weight in air we
will have the <i>loss of weight in water</i>, and this
equals the <i>weight of an equal volume of water</i>,
which is precisely what we got by our bottle
method.</p>

<p>We now need only divide the weight in air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
by the loss of weight in water, and we shall
have the specific gravity of the stone.</p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 307px;"><a name="fig6" id="fig6"></a>
<img src="images/008.png" width="307" height="443" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.</div>

<p>To actually weigh the stone in water we must
use a fine wire to support the stone. We must
first find how much this wire itself weighs
(when attached by a small loop to the hook
that supports the balance pan and trailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
partly in the water, as will be the case when
weighing the stone in water). This weight of the
wire must of course be deducted to get the true
weight of the stone in water. The beaker of water
is best supported by a small table that stands over
the balance pan. One can easily be made out
of the pieces of a cigar box. (See <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>.)</p>

<p>The wire that is to support the stone should
have a spiral at the bottom in which to lay the
gem, and this should be so placed that the latter
will be completely submerged at all times, but
not touching bottom or sides of the beaker.</p>

specific gravity by the method of weighing
in water:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Here the specific gravity, 4.02 would indicate
some corundum gem (ruby or sapphire),
and the other characters would indicate at
once which it was.</p>

<p>The student who means to master the use
of the two methods given in <a href="#LESSON_V">Lessons V.</a> and <a href="#LESSON_VI">VI.</a>
should proceed to practice them with stones of
known specific gravities until he can at least
get the correct result to the first decimal place.
It is not to be expected that accurate results
can be had in the second decimal place, with
the balances usually available to jewelers.
When the learner can determine specific gravities
with some certainty he should then try
unknown gems.</p>

<p>The specific gravity method is of especial
value in distinguishing between the various
colorless stones, as, for example, quartz crystal,
true white topaz, white sapphire, white or
colorless beryl, etc. These are all doubly refractive,
have no color, and hence no dichroism,
and unless one has a refractometer to get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
refractive index, they are difficult to distinguish.
The specific gravities are very different,
however, and readily serve to distinguish them.
It should be added that the synthetic stones
show the same specific gravities as their natural
counterparts, so that this test does not serve
to detect them.</p>

<p>Where many gems are to be handled and
separated by specific gravity determinations,
perhaps the best way to do so is to have several
liquids of known specific gravity and to see
what stones will float and what ones will sink
in the liquids. Methylene iodide is a heavy
liquid (sp. g. 3.32), on which a "quartz-topaz,"
for example, sp. g. 2.66, would float, but a true
topaz, sp. g. 3.53, would sink in it. By diluting
methylene iodide with benzol (sp. g. 0.88)
any specific gravity that is desired may be had
(between the two limits 0.88 and 3.32). Specimens
of known specific gravity are used with
such liquids and their behavior (as to whether
they sink or float, or remain suspended in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
liquid,) indicates the specific gravity of the
liquid. An unknown stone may then be used
and its behavior noted and compared with
that of a known specimen, whereby one can
easily find out whether the unknown is heavier
or lighter than the known sample.</p>

<p>An excellent account of the detail of this
method is given in G. F. Herbert-Smith's <i>Gem-Stones</i>,
pages 64-71, of Chapter VIII., and
various liquids are there recommended. It is
doubtful if the practical gem dealer would find
these methods necessary in most cases. Where
large numbers of many different unknown
gems have to be determined it would pay to
prepare, and standardize, and use such solutions.</p>

<h2>LESSON VII</h2>
<h3>LUSTER AND OTHER REFLECTION EFFECTS</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">By</span> the term <i>luster</i> we refer to the manner
and degree in which light is reflected
from the <i>surface</i> of a material. Surfaces of
the same material, but of varying degrees of
smoothness would, of course, vary in the vividness
of their luster, but the type of variation
that may be made use of to help distinguish
gems, depends upon the character of the
material more than upon the degree of smoothness
of its surface. Just as silk has so typical
a luster that we speak of it as silky luster, and
just as pearl has a pearly luster, so certain gems
have peculiar and characteristic luster. The
diamond gives us a good example. Most
diamond dealers distinguish between real and
imitation diamonds at a glance by the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the luster. That is the chief, and perhaps
the only property, that they rely upon for deciding
the genuineness of a diamond, and they
are fairly safe in so doing, for, with the exception
of certain artificially decolorized zircons, no
gem stone is likely to deceive one who is
familiar with the luster of the diamond. It is
not to be denied that a fine white zircon, when
finely cut, may deceive even one who is familiar
with diamonds. The author has fooled many
diamond experts with an especially fine zircon,
for the luster of zircon does approach, though
it hardly equals, that of the diamond. Rough
zircons are frequently mistaken for diamonds
by diamond prospectors, and even by pickers
in the mines, so that some care should be exercised
in any suspicious case, and one should not
then rely solely on the luster. However, in most
cases in the trade there is almost no chance of
the unexpected presence of a zircon and the
luster test is usually sufficient to distinguish
the diamond. (Zircons are strongly doubly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
refractive, as was said in <a href="#LESSON_III">Lesson III.</a> on Double
Refraction, and with a lens the doubling of the
back lines may be seen.)</p>

<p><b>Adamantine Luster.</b> The luster of a diamond
is called <i>adamantine</i> (the adjective uses the
Greek name for the stone itself). It is keen
and cold and glittering, having a metallic suggestion.
A very large per cent. of the light
that falls upon the surface of a diamond at any
low angle is reflected, hence the keenness of its
luster. If a diamond and some other white
stone, say a white sapphire, are held so as to
reflect at the same time images of an incandescent
light into the eye of the observer, such
a direct comparison will serve to show that
much more light comes to the eye from the
diamond surface than from the sapphire surface.
The image of the light filament, as seen
from the diamond, is much keener than as seen
from the sapphire. The same disparity would
exist between the diamond and almost any
other stone. Zircon comes nearest to having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
adamantine luster of any of the other gems.
The green garnet that is called "olivine" in the
trade also approaches diamond in luster, hence
the name "demantoid," or diamond like, sometimes
applied to it.</p>

<p><b>Vitreous Luster.</b> The other stones nearly
all have what is called <i>vitreous</i> luster (literally,
glass like), yet owing to difference of hardness,
and consequent minute differences in fineness
of surface finish, the keenness of this vitreous
luster varies slightly in different stones, and a
trained eye can obtain clues to the identity of
certain stones by means of a consideration of
the luster. Garnets, for example, being harder
than glass, take a keener polish, and a glance at
a doublet (of which the hard top is usually
garnet and the base of glass) will show that the
light is better reflected from the garnet part of
the top slope than from the glass part. This
use of luster affords the quickest and surest
means of detecting a doublet. One can even
tell a doublet inside a show window, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the observer be outside on the sidewalk, by
moving to a position such that a reflection from
the top slope of the stone is to be had. When
a doublet has a complete garnet top no such
direct comparison can be had, but by viewing
first the top luster, and then the back luster,
in rapid succession, one can tell whether or
not the stone is a doublet.</p>

<p><b>Oily Luster.</b> Certain stones, notably the
peridot (or chrysolite) and the hessonite (or
cinnamon stone), have an oily luster. This is
possibly due to reflection of light that has penetrated
the surface slightly and then been
reflected from disturbed layers beneath the surface.
At any rate, the difference in luster may
be made use of by those who have trained their
eyes to appreciate it. Much practice will be
needed before one can expect to tell at a glance
when he has a peridot (or chrysolite) by the
luster alone, but it will pay to spend some spare
time in studying the luster of the various stones.</p>

<p>A true, or "precious" topaz, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
may be compared with a yellow quartz-topaz,
and owing to the greater hardness of the true
topaz, it will be noted that it has a slightly
keener luster than the other stone, although
both have vitreous luster. Similarly the corundum
gems (ruby and sapphire), being even
harder than true topaz, take a splendid surface
finish and have a very keen vitreous luster.</p>

<p>Turquoise has a dull waxy luster, due to its
slight hardness. Malachite, although soft, has,
perhaps because of its opacity, a keen and
sometimes almost metallic luster.</p>

<p>One may note the luster rapidly, without
apparatus and without damage to the stone.
We thus have a test which, while it is not conclusive
except in a very few cases, will supplement
and serve to confirm other tests, or
perhaps, if used at first, will suggest what other
tests to apply.</p>

<p>Another optical effect that serves to distinguish
some stones depends upon the reflection
of light from within the material due to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
certain lack of homogeneity in the substance.</p>

<p><b>Cause of Color in the Opal.</b> Thus the opal
is distinguished by the prismatic colors that
emerge from it owing to the effect of thin layers
of material of slightly different density, and
hence of different refractive index from the
rest of the material. These thin films act much
as do soap-bubble films, to interfere with light
of certain wave lengths, but to reflect certain
other wave lengths and hence certain colors.</p>

<p>Again, in some sapphires and rubies are
found minute, probably hollow, tube-like cavities,
arranged in three sets in the same positions
as the transverse axes of the hexagonal crystal.
The surfaces of these tubes reflect light so as
to produce a six-pointed star effect, especially
when the stone is properly cut to a high, round
cabochon form, whose base is parallel to the
successive layers of tubes.</p>

<p><b>Starstones, Moonstones, Cat's-eyes.</b> In the
moonstone we have another sort of effect, this
time due to the presence of hosts of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
twin crystal layers that reflect light so as to
produce a sort of moonlight-on-the-water
appearance <i>within</i> the stone when the latter is
properly cut, with the layers of twin crystals
parallel to its base. Ceylon-cut moonstones
are frequently cut to save weight, and may
have to be recut to properly place the layers so
that the effect may be seen equally over all
parts of the stone, as set.</p>

<p>Cat's-eye and tiger's-eye owe their peculiar
appearance to the presence, within them, of
many fine, parallel, silky fibers. The quartz
cat's-eye was probably once an asbestos-like
mineral, whose soft fibers were replaced by
quartz in solution, and the latter, while giving
its hardness to the new mineral, also took up
the fibrous arrangement of the original material.
The true chrysoberyl cat's-eye also has a somewhat
similar fibrous or perhaps tubular structure.
Such stones, when cut <i>en cabochon</i>, show
a thin sharp line of light running across the center
of the stone (when properly cut with the base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
parallel to the fibers). This is due to reflection of
light from the surfaces of the parallel fibers. The
line of light runs perpendicularly to the fibers.</p>

<p>In these cases (opals, starstones, moonstones,
and cat's-eyes) the individual stone is usually
easily distinguished from other kinds of stones
by its peculiar behavior towards light. However,
it must be remembered that other species
than corundum furnish starstones (amethyst
and other varieties of quartz, for example),
so that it does not follow that any starstone
is a corundum gem. Also the more valuable
chrysoberyl cat's-eye may be confused with the
cheaper quartz cat's-eye unless one is well
acquainted with the respective appearances of
the two varieties. Whenever there is any
doubt other tests should be applied.</p>

<p>For further account of luster and other types
of reflection effects see <i>Gem-Stones</i>, by G. F.
Herbert-Smith, Chapter V., pp. 37-39, or <i>A
Handbook of Precious Stones</i>, M. D. Rothschild,

<h2>LESSON VIII</h2>
<h3>HARDNESS</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Another</span> property by means of which
one may distinguish the various gems
from each other is <i>hardness</i>. By hardness
is meant the ability to resist scratching. The
term "hardness" should not be taken to include
toughness, yet it is frequently so understood
by the public. Most hard stones are more or
less brittle and would shatter if struck a sharp
blow. Other hard stones have a pronounced
<i>cleavage</i> and split easily in certain directions.
True hardness, then, implies merely the ability
to resist abrasion (<i>i. e.</i>, scratching).</p>

<p>Now, not only is hardness very necessary
in a precious stone in order that it may
<i>receive</i> and <i>keep</i> a fine polish, but the degree
in which it possesses hardness as compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
with other materials of known hardness may
be made use of in identifying it.</p>

<p>No scale of <i>absolute</i> hardness has ever come
into general use, but the mineralogist Mohs
many years ago proposed the following <i>relative</i>
scale, which has been used very largely:</p>

<p><b>Mohs's Scale of Hardness.</b> Diamond, the
hardest of all gems, was rated as 10 by Mohs.
This rating was purely arbitrary. Mohs might
have called it 100 or 1 with equal reason. It
was merely in order to represent the different
degrees of hardness by numbers, that he picked
out the number 10 to assign to diamonds.
Sapphire (and ruby) Mohs called 9, as being
next to diamond in hardness. True topaz
(precious topaz) he called 8. Quartz (amethyst
and quartz "topaz") was given the number 7.
Feldspar (moonstone) was rated 6, the mineral
apatite 5, fluorspar 4, calcite 3, gypsum 2, and
talc 1.</p>

<p>It may be said here that any mineral in
this series, that is of higher number than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
any other, will scratch the other. Thus diamond
(10) will scratch all the others, sapphire
(9) will scratch any but diamond, topaz
(8) will scratch any but diamond and sapphire,
and so on.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that there is any regularity
in the degrees of hardness as expressed
by these numbers. The intervals in hardness
are by no means equal to the differences
in number. Thus the interval between diamond
and sapphire, although given but one
number of difference, is probably greater than
that between sapphire (9) and talc (1). The
numbers thus merely give us an order of hardness.
Many gem minerals are, of course, missing
from this list, and most of the minerals from
5 down to 1 are not gem minerals at all. Few
gem materials are of less hardness than 7, for
any mineral less hard than quartz (7) will inevitably
be worn and dulled in time by the
ordinary road dust, which contains much
powdered quartz.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>In testing a gem for hardness the problem
consists in finding out which of the above
minerals is most nearly equal in hardness to the
unknown stone. Any gem that was approximately
equal in hardness to a true topaz (8)
would also be said to be of hardness 8. Thus
spinel is of about the same hardness as topaz and
hence is usually rated as 8 in hardness. Similarly
opal, moonstone, and turquoise are of
about the same hardness as feldspar and are all
rated 6.</p>

<p>Frequently stones will be found that in
hardness are between some two of Mohs's minerals.
In that case we add one half to the
number of the softer mineral; thus, peridot,
benitoite, and jade (nephrite) are all softer than
quartz (7) but harder than feldspar (6); hence we
say they are 6<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> in hardness. Beryl (aquamarine
and emerald), garnet (almandine),
and zircon are rated 7<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> in hardness, being
softer than true topaz but harder than
quartz. A table of the hardness of most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the commonly known gem-stones follows this
lesson.</p>

<p>Having now an idea of what hardness means
and how it is expressed, we must next inquire
how one may make use of it in identifying
unknown gems.</p>

<p><b>How to Apply the Hardness Test.</b> In the first
place, it is necessary to caution the beginner
against damaging a fine gem by attempting to
test its hardness in any but the most careful
manner. The time-honored file test is really a
hardness test and serves nicely to distinguish
genuine gems, of hardness 7 or above, from
glass imitations. A well-hardened steel file is
of not quite hardness 7, and glass of various
types while varying somewhat averages
between 5 and 6. Hence, glass imitations
are easily attacked by a file. To make the
file test use only a <i>very fine</i> file and apply it with
a light but firm pressure lengthwise along the
girdle (edge) of the unset stone. If damage
results it will then be almost unnoticeable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Learn to know the <i>feel</i> of the file as it
takes hold of a substance softer than itself.
Also learn the <i>sound</i>. If applied to a hard
stone a file will slip on it, as a skate slips on
ice. It will not take hold as upon a softer
substance.</p>

<p>If the stone is set, press a sharp corner
of a broken-ended file gently against a <i>back</i>
facet, preferably high up toward the girdle,
where any damage will not be visible from the
front, and move the file very slightly along the
surface, noting by the <i>feel</i> whether or not it
takes hold and also looking with a lens to see if
a scratch has been made. Do not mistake a
line of steel, left on a slightly rough surface, for
a true scratch. Frequently on an unpolished
girdle of real gem material the file will leave
a streak of steel. Similarly when using test
minerals in accordance with what follows do not
mistake a streak of powder from the yielding
test material, for a true scratch in the material
being tested. The safe way is to wipe the spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
thus removing any powder. A true scratch
will, of course, persist.</p>

<p>A doublet, being usually constructed
of a garnet top and a glass back, may
resist a file at the girdle if the garnet
top covers the stone to the girdle, as is
sometimes the case, especially in the smaller
sizes. In this case the back must be
tested.</p>

<p>One should never pass a file rudely across
the corners or edges of the facets on any stone
that may be genuine, as such treatment really
amounts to a series of light hammer blows, and
the brittleness of most gem stones would cause
them to yield, irrespective of their hardness.
It should be remembered that some genuine
stones are softer than a file, so that it will not
do to reject as worthless any material that is
attacked by a file. Lapis lazuli (5), sphene
(5), opal (6), moonstone (6), amazonite (6),
turquoise (6), peridot (6<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>), demantoid garnet
(6<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>) (the "olivine" of the trade), and jade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
(nephrite) (6<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>), are all more or less attacked
by a file.</p>

<h2>LESSON IX</h2>
<h3>HARDNESS&mdash;<i>Continued</i></h3>

<p><b>Minerals Used in Testing Hardness.</b> For
testing stones that are harder than a file the
student should provide himself with the following
set of materials:</p>

<p>1. A small crystal of carborundum. (Most
hardware stores have specimen crystals as
attractive advertisements of carborundum as
an abrasive material, or the Carborundum Co.,
Niagara Falls, N. Y., will supply one.)</p>

<p>2. A small crystal of sapphire (not of gem
quality, but it should be transparent and
compact. A pale or colorless Montana sapphire
can be had for a few cents of any mineral
dealer).</p>

<p>3. A small <i>true topaz</i> crystal. (The pure
white topaz of Thomas Mountain, Utah, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
excellent; or white topaz from Brazil or Japan
or Mexico or Colorado will do. Any mineral
house can furnish small crystals for a few
cents when not of specially fine crystallization.)</p>

<p>4. A small quartz crystal. (This may be
either amethyst or quartz-topaz or the common
colorless variety. The fine, sharp, colorless
crystals from Herkimer County, N. Y., are
excellent. These are very inexpensive.)</p>

<p>5. A fragment of a crystal of feldspar. (Common
orthoclase feldspar, which is frequently
of a brownish pink or flesh color, will do.)</p>

<p>These five test stones represent the following
degrees of hardness:</p>

<p>1. Carborundum is harder than any gem
material but diamond. It will scratch sapphire
and ruby, which are rated 9 in hardness,
hence we may call carborundum 9<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> if we wish.
It is, however, very much softer than diamond,
and the latter will scratch it upon the slightest
pressure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Sapphire, of hardness 9, scratching any
gem material except diamond.</p>

<p>3. True topaz, of hardness 8. It is scratched
by sapphire (and, of course, ruby), also by
chrysoberyl (which is hence rated 8<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>), but
scratches most other stones. Spinel (which
is also rated as 8 in hardness) is really a bit
harder than topaz.</p>

<p>4. Quartz, of hardness 7, and scratched
by all the previous stones but scratching
those that were listed above as of less hardness
than a file.</p>

<p>5. Feldspar, of hardness 6, hence slightly
softer than a file and yielding to it, but scratching
the stones likewise rated as 6 when applied
forcibly to them. Also scratching stones rated
as less than 6 on slight pressure.</p>

<p>We must next consider how these minerals
may be safely used upon gem material. Obviously
it would be far safer to use them upon
rough gem material than upon cut stones.
However, with care and some little skill, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
may make hardness tests without particular
danger to fine cut material.</p>

<p>The way to proceed is to apply the cut
stone (preferably its girdle, or if that is so
set as not to be available, a corner where
several facets meet) gently to the flat surface
of one of the softer test stones, drawing
it lightly along the surface and noting
the <i>feel</i> and looking to see if a scratch results.
If the test stone is scratched try the next
harder test stone similarly. <i>Do not attempt
to use the test stone upon any valuable cut stone.</i>
Proceed as above until the gem meets a test
stone that it does not attack. Its hardness
is then probably equal to the latter and perhaps
if pressed forcibly against it a slight scratch
would result, but it is not advisable to resort to
heavy pressure. A light touch should be cultivated
in this work. Having now an indication
as to the hardness of the unknown gem look
up in the table of the previous lesson those
gems of similar hardness and then by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
use of some of the tests already given decide
which of the stones of that degree of hardness
you have. <i>Never rely upon a single test in identifying
a gem.</i></p>

<p>For further study of hardness and its use
in testing gems see <i>Gem-Stones</i>, G. F. Herbert-Smith,
Chap. IX., pp. 78-81, and table on
p. 305; or see <i>A Handbook of Precious Stones</i>,
Rothschild, pp. 19, 20, 21.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_X" id="LESSON_X"></a>LESSON X</h2>
<h3>DISPERSION</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Another</span> property which may be made
use of in deciding the identity of certain
gems is that called <i>dispersion</i>. We have seen in
<a href="#LESSON_II">Lesson II.</a> that light in entering a stone from
the air changes its path (refraction), and in
<a href="#LESSON_III">Lesson III.</a> it was explained that many minerals
cause light that enters them, to divide and proceed
along two different paths (double refraction).
Now it is further true that light of
the various colors (red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, and violet) is refracted variously&mdash;the
violet being bent most sharply, the red least,
and the other colors to intermediate degrees.
The cut (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>) represents roughly and in an
exaggerated manner the effect we are discussing.</p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 322px;"><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a>
<img src="images/009.png" width="322" height="164" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.</div>

<p>Now in a cut stone this separation of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of different colors, or dispersion of light, as it
is called, results in the reflection of each of the
colors separately from the steep sloping back
facets of the stone. If almost any clear,
colorless facetted stone is placed in the sunlight
and a card held before it to receive the reflections,
it will be seen that rainbow-like reflections
appear on the card. These <i>spectra</i>, as they are
called, are caused by the dispersion of light.
With a diamond the spectra will be very brilliant
and of vivid coloring, and the red will
be widely separated from the blue. With white
sapphire or white topaz, or with rock crystal
(quartz), the spectra will be less vivid&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
will appear in pairs (due to the double
refraction of these minerals), and the red
and blue will be near together (<i>i. e.</i>, the
spectra will be short). This shortness in the
latter cases is due to the small dispersive
power of the three minerals mentioned.
Paste (lead glass) gives fairly vivid spectra,
and they are single like those from diamond,
as glass is singly refracting. The dispersion
of the heavy lead glass approaches that of
diamond. The decolorized zircon (jargoon) has
a dispersion well up toward that of diamond
and gives fairly vivid spectra on a card, but
they are double, as zircon is doubly refracting.
Sphene (a gem rarely seen in the trade) and
the demantoid garnet (a green gem often called
"olivine" in the trade) both have very high
dispersive power, exceeding the diamond in this
respect. As they are both colored stones
(sphene is usually yellowish, sometimes greenish
or brown), the vividness of their color-play is
much diminished by absorption of light within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
them. So also the color-play of a deeply
colored fancy diamond is diminished by absorption.</p>

<p><b>Dispersion as a Test of the Identity of a Gem.</b>
We may now consider how an acquaintance
with the dispersive powers of the various stones
can be used in distinguishing them. If a stone
has high dispersive power it will exhibit "fire,"
as it is called&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the various colors will be so
widely separated within the stone, and hence
reflected out so widely separated, that they will
fall on the eye (as on the card above) in separate
layers, and vivid flashes of red or yellow or
other colors will be seen. Such stones as the
white sapphire (and others of small dispersion),
however, while separating the various
colors appreciably as seen reflected on a card,
do not sufficiently separate them to produce
the "fire" effect when the light falls on the eye.
This is because the various colors, being very
near together in this case, cross the eye so
rapidly, when the stone is moved, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
blend their effect and the eye regards the light
that thus falls upon it as white. We have here
a ready means of distinguishing the diamond
from most other colorless gems. The trained
diamond expert relies (probably unconsciously)
upon the dispersive effect (or "fire") nearly as
much as upon the adamantine luster, in telling
at a glance whether a stone is or is not a diamond.
Of all colorless stones, the only one likely to
mislead the expert in this respect is the whitened
zircon (jargoon), which has almost adamantine
luster and in addition nearly as high dispersive
power as diamond. However, zircon is doubly
refracting (strongly so), and the division of the
spectra which results (each facet producing
two instead of only one) weakens the "fire" so
that even the best zircon is a bit "sleepy" as
compared with even an ordinary diamond.</p>

<p>In addition to providing a ready means of
identifying the diamond, a high degree of dispersion
in a stone of pronounced color would
lead one to consider sphene, demantoid garnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
(if green), and zircon (which might be reddish,
yellowish, brown, or of other colors), and if the
stone did not agree with these in its other
properties one should suspect <i>glass</i>.</p>

<p>A good way to note the degree of dispersion,
aside from the sunlight-card method, is to look
at the stone from the back while holding it up
to the light (daylight). Stones of high dispersive
power will display vivid color play in this
position. Glass imitations of rubies, emeralds,
amethysts, etc., will display altogether too
much dispersion for the natural gems.</p>

<p>In Chap. III., p. 20, of G. F. Herbert-Smith's
<i>Gem-Stones</i>, a brief account of dispersion is
given. College text-books on physics also treat
of it, and the latter give an account of how
dispersion is measured and what is meant by a
coefficient of dispersion. Most gem books say
little about it, but as we have seen above, a
knowledge of the matter can, when supplemented
by other tests, be applied practically in
distinguishing gems.</p>

<h2>LESSON XI</h2>
<h3>COLOR</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> reserving to the last the property of <i>color</i>,
which many dealers in gems use first when
attempting to identify a precious stone, I have
sought to point out the fact that a determination
based solely upon color is very likely to be
wrong. So many mineral species are found in
so many different colors that to attempt to
identify any mineral species by color alone
is usually to invite disaster. The emerald,
alone among gems, has, when of fine color, a
hue that is not approached by any other species.
The color of the grass in the springtime fitly
describes it. Yet even here the art of man has
so closely counterfeited in glass the green of the
emerald that one cannot be sure of his stone by
color alone. As was suggested earlier in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
lessons, the writer has several times recently
had occasion to condemn as glass imitations
stones for which high prices had been paid as
genuine emeralds, those who sold them having
relied solely upon a trained eye for color.</p>

<p><b>Confusion of Gems Due to Similarity of Color.</b>
The same tendency to rely upon color causes
many in the trade to call all yellow stones
"topaz" whether the species be corundum
(oriental topaz), true topaz (precious topaz),
citrine quartz (quartz topaz), heliodor (yellow
beryl), jacinth (yellow zircon), or what not.</p>

<p>Similarly the public calls all red stones ruby.
Thus we have "cape ruby" and "Arizona
ruby" (pyrope garnet), "spinel ruby" (more
properly ruby spinel), "Siam ruby" (very
dark red corundum), "Ceylon ruby" (pale
pinkish corundum), rubellite (pink tourmaline),
and lastly Burmah ruby (the fine blood-red
corundum).</p>

<p>While it is true that color, unless skillfully
estimated and wisely used in conjunction with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
other properties, is a most unreliable guide,
yet when thus used, it becomes a great help
and serves sometimes to narrow down the chase,
at the start, to a very few species. To thus
make use of it requires an actual acquaintance
with the various gem materials, in their usual
colors and shades and an eye trained to note and
to remember minute differences of tint and
shade. The suggestions which follow as to
usual colors of mineral species must then be
used only with discretion and after much faithful
study of many specimens of each of the
species.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the beginning color of the
visible spectrum, red, and consider how a close
study of shades of red can help in distinguishing
the various red stones from each other. In the
first place we will inquire what mineral species
are likely to furnish us with red stones. Omitting
a number of rare minerals, we have (1)
corundum ruby, (2) garnet of various types,
(3) zircon, (4) spinel, (5) tourmaline. These five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
minerals are about the only common species
which give us an out-and-out red stone.
Let us now consider the distinctions between
the reds of these different species. The red
of the ruby, whether dark (Siam type), blood
red (Burmah type), or pale (Ceylon), is more
pleasing usually than the red of any of the
other species. Viewed from the back of the
stone (by transmitted light) it is still pleasing.
It may be purplish, but is seldom orange red.
Also, owing to the dichroism of the ruby the
red is variable according to the changing position
of the stone. It therefore has a certain
life and variety not seen in any of the others
except perhaps in red tourmaline, which, however,
does not approach ruby in fineness of red
color.</p>

<p><b>Red Stones of Similar Shades.</b> The garnet,
on the other hand, when of fire-red hue, is darker
than any but the Siam ruby. It is also more
inclined to orange red or brownish red&mdash;and the
latter is especially true when the stone is seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
against the light (by transmitted light). Its
color then resembles that of a solution of "iron"
such as is given as medicine. The so-called
"almandine" garnets (those of purplish-red
tint) do not equal the true ruby in brightness
of color and when held up to the light show
more prismatic colors than the true ruby,
owing to the greater dispersion of garnet.
The color also lacks variety (owing to lack
of dichroism). While a fine garnet may make
a fair-looking "ruby" when by itself, it looks
inferior and dark when beside a fine ruby. By
artificial light, too, the garnet is dark as compared
with the true ruby, and the latter shows
its color at a distance much more strongly than
the garnet.</p>

<p>The red zircon, or true hyacinth, is rare.
(Many hessonite garnets are sold as hyacinths
in the trade. These are usually of a brownish
red.) The red of the hyacinth is never equal to
that of the ruby. It is usually more somber, and
a bit inclined to a brownish cast. The dispersion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of zircon, too, is so large (about 87 per cent.
of that of diamond) that some little "color-play"
is likely to appear along with the intrinsic
color. The luster too is almost adamantine
while that of ruby is softer and vitreous. Although
strongly doubly refracting, the hyacinth
shows scarcely any dichroism and thus lacks
variety of color. Hence a trained eye will at
once note these differences and not confound
the stone with ruby.</p>

<p>Spinels, when red, are almost always more
yellowish or more purplish than fine corundum
rubies. They are also singly refracting and
hence exhibit no dichroism and therefore lack
variety of color as compared with true ruby.
Some especially fine ones, however, are of a good
enough red to deceive even jewelers of experience,
and one in particular that I have in
mind has been the rounds of the stores and
has never been pronounced a spinel, although
several "experts" have insisted that it was a
scientific ruby. The use of a dichroscope would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
have saved them that error, for the stone is
singly refracting. Spinels are usually clearer
and more transparent than garnets and show
their color better at a distance or when in a poor
light.</p>

<p>Tourmaline of the reddish variety (rubellite)
is seldom of a deep red. It is more inclined
to be pinkish. The dichroism of tourmaline
is stronger than that of ruby and more obvious
to the unaided eye. The red of the rubellite
should not deceive anyone who has ever seen a
fine corundum ruby.</p>

<h4>YELLOW STONES</h4>

<p>Considering next the stones of yellow color,
we have the following species to deal with:
(1) diamond, (2) corundum, (3) precious topaz,
(4) quartz, (5) beryl, (6) zircon, (7) tourmaline.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Zircon Resembles Yellow Diamond.</b>
Here we have less opportunity to judge of
the species by the color than was the case with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the red stones. The diamond, of course, is
easy to tell, not by the kind of yellow that it
displays, for it varies greatly in that respect, but
rather by its prismatic play blended with the
intrinsic color. Its luster also gives an immediate
clue to its identity. It is necessary, however,
to be sure that we are not being deceived
by a yellow zircon, for the latter has considerable
"fire" and a keen luster. Its strong double
refraction and its relative softness, as well as its
great density will serve to distinguish it. Of the
other yellow stones, the true or precious topaz
is frequently inclined to a pinkish or wine yellow
and many such stones lose all their yellow
(retaining their pink) when gently heated.
The so-called "pinked" topazes are thus produced.</p>

<p>The yellow corundum rarely has a color
that is at all distinctive. As far as color
goes the material might be yellow quartz,
or yellow beryl, or yellow zircon, or yellow
tourmaline (Ceylon type). Many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
yellowish tourmalines have a decidedly greenish
cast (greenish-yellow chrysoberyl might
resemble these also). However, in general if
one has a yellow stone to determine it will be
safer to make specific gravity or hardness tests,
or both, before deciding, rather than to rely
upon color.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_XII" id="LESSON_XII"></a>LESSON XII</h2>
<h3>COLOR&mdash;<i>Continued</i></h3>

<h4>GREEN STONES</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Let</span> us first consider what mineral species
are most likely to give us green stones.
Omitting the semi-precious opaque or translucent
stones we have:</p>

<div class="bq"><p>1. Grass-green beryl (the emerald) which is,
of course, first in value among the green stones
and first in the fine quality of its color.</p>

<p>2. Tourmaline (some specimens of which
perhaps more nearly approach the emerald
than any other green stones).</p>

<p>3. The demantoid garnet (sometimes called
"olivine" in the trade).</p>

<p>4. True olivine (the peridot and the chrysolite
of the trade).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Bluish-green beryl (aquamarine).</p>

<p>6. Green sapphire (Oriental emerald or
Oriental aquamarine).</p>

<p>7. Chrysoberyl (alexandrite and also the
greenish-yellow chrysoberyl).</p></div>

<p>1. Considering first the emerald, we have
as legitimate a use of color in distinguishing
a stone as could be selected, for emerald of fine
grass-green color is not equaled by any other
precious stone in the rich velvety character of
its color. We have to beware here, however, of
the fine glass imitations, which, while lacking
the variety of true emerald, because of lack of
dichroism, are nevertheless of a color so nearly
like that of the emerald that no one should
attempt to decide by color alone as to whether
a stone is genuine or imitation emerald. If a
hardness test shows that the material is a genuine
hard stone and not a paste, then one who is
well accustomed to the color of fine emerald can
say at once whether a stone is a fine emerald
or some other hard green stone. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the color is less fine, however, one might
well refuse to decide by the color, even when
sure that the material is not glass, for some
fine tourmalines approach some of the poorer
emeralds in richness of color.</p>

<p><b>The "Scientific Emerald" Fraud.</b> No
"scientific" emeralds of marketable size have
ever been produced as far as can be learned.
Many attempts to reproduce emerald by
melting beryl or emerald of inferior color have
resulted only in the production of a beryl glass,
which, while its color might be of desirable
shade, was softer and lighter in weight than
true emerald. It was also a true glass and
hence singly refracting and without dichroism,
whereas emerald is crystalline (not glassy or
amorphous), is doubly refracting, and shows
dichroism.</p>

<p>Do not be misled, then, into buying or
selling an imitation of emerald under the
terms "synthetic," "scientific," or "reconstructed,"
as such terms, when so used, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
used to deceive one into thinking that the
product offered bears the same relation to
the true emerald that scientific rubies and
sapphires bear to the natural stones. Such
is not the case.</p>

<p>About the most dangerous imitation of the
emerald that is ever seen in the trade is the triplet
that has a top and a back made of true but
pale beryl (the same mineral as emerald, but
not of the right color) and a thin slice of
deep emerald green glass laid between. This
slice of glass is usually placed behind the
girdle so that a file will not find any point
of attack. The specific gravity of the triplet
is practically that of emerald, its color
is often very good, and it is doubly refracting.
It is thus a dangerous imitation. (See <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Emerald Triplets.</b> A careful examination of
one of these triplets, in the unset condition,
with a good lens, will reveal the thin line of
junction of the beryl with the glass. (The
surface lusters of the two materials are enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
different for the trained eye to detect the margin
at once.) Such a triplet, if held in the sun, will
reflect onto a card two images in pale or white
light, one coming from the top surface of the
table and the other from the top surface of
the glass slice within. In other words, it acts
in this respect like a doublet. A true emerald
would give only one such reflection, which
would come from the top surface of the
table.</p>

<div class="figc"><a name="fig8" id="fig8"></a>
<img src="images/010.png" width="314" height="120" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;EMERALD TRIPLET.</div>

<p>2. Tourmalines, when green, are usually
darker than emeralds and of a more pronounced
yellow green, or they may be of
too bluish a green, as is the case with some
of the finest of the green tourmalines from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Maine. Connecticut green tourmaline tends
more to the dark yellowish green, and Ceylon
tourmaline to the olive green. The stronger
dichroism of the tourmaline frequently reveals
itself to the naked eye, and there is usually
one direction or position in which the color
of the stone is very inferior to its color in the
opposite direction or position. Most tourmalines
(except the very lightest shades) must
be cut so that the table of the finished stone
lies on the side of the crystal, as, when cut with
the table lying across the crystal (perpendicular
to the principal optical axis) the stones are
much too dark to be pretty. Hence when one
turns the cut stone so that he is looking in the
direction which was originally up and down
the crystal (the direction of single refraction
and of no dichroism) he gets a glimpse of a
less lovely color than is furnished by the
stone in other positions. With a true emerald
no such disparity in the color would appear.
There might be a slight change of shade (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
seen by the naked eye), but no trace of an ugly
shade would appear.</p>

<p>By studying many tourmalines and a few
emeralds one may acquire an eye for the differences
of color that characterize the two stones,
but it is still necessary to beware of the fine
glass imitation and to use the file and also to
look with a high-power glass for any rounding
bubbles. The emerald will never have the latter.
The glass imitation frequently does have
them. The sharp jagged flaws and cracks that
so often appear in emerald are likely to appear
also in tourmaline as both are brittle materials.
The glass imitations frequently have such flaws
put into them either by pinching or by striking
the material. Frequently, too, wisps of tiny
air bubbles are left in the glass imitations in
such fashion that unless one scrutinizes them
carefully with a good lens they strongly resemble
the flaws in natural emerald.</p>

<p>I have thus gone into detail as to how one
may distinguish true emerald from tourmaline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and from glass imitations because, on account of
the high value of fine emerald and its infrequent
occurrence, there is perhaps more need for the
ability to discriminate between it and its imitations
and substitutes than there is in almost
any other case. Where values are high the
temptation to devise and to sell imitations
or substitutes is great and the need for skill in
distinguishing between the real and the false
is proportionally great.</p>

<p>3. The demantoid garnet (often unfortunately
and incorrectly called "olivine" in
the trade) is usually of an olive or pistachio
shade. It may, however, approach a pale
emerald. The refraction being single in this,
as in all garnets, there is little variety to the
color. The dispersion being very high, however,
there is a strong tendency, in spite of the
depth of the body color, for this stone to display
"fire," that is, rainbow color effects. The
luster, too, is diamond-like as the name "demantoid"
signifies. With this account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
stone and a few chances to see the real demantoid
garnet beside an emerald no one would
be likely to mistake one for the other.
The demantoid garnet is also very soft as
compared with emerald (6<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> as against
nearly 8).</p>

<p>4. True olivine (the peridot or the chrysolite
of the trade) is of a fine leaf-green or bottle-green
shade in the peridot. The chrysolite of
the jeweler is usually of a yellower green.
Frequently an olive-green shade is seen. The
luster of olivine (whether of the peridot shade
or not) is oily, and this may serve to distinguish
it from tourmaline (which it may resemble
in color). Its double refraction is very large
also, so that the doubling of the edges of the
rear facets may easily be seen through the table
with a lens. The dichroism is feeble too,
whereas that of tourmaline is strong. No
one would be likely to confuse the stone
with true emerald after studying what has
preceded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Bluish-green beryl (aquamarine) is usually
of a pale transparent green or blue green
(almost a pure pale blue is also found).</p>

<p>Having all the properties of its more valuable
variety, emerald, the pale beryl may, by the
use of these properties, be distinguished from
the pale blue-green topaz which so strongly
resembles it in color.</p>

<p>6. Green sapphire seldom even approaches
emerald in fineness of color. When it remotely
suggests emerald it is called "Oriental" emerald
to denote that it is a corundum gem. Most
green sapphires are of too blue a green to resemble
emerald. Some are really "Oriental"
aquamarines. In some cases the green of the
green sapphire is due to the presence, within
the cut stone, of both blue and yellow portions,
the light from which, being blended by its reflection
within the stone, emerges as green as
seen by the unaided eye, which cannot analyze
colors. The dark sapphires of Australia are
frequently green when cut in one direction and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
deep blue when cut in the opposite direction.
The green, however, is seldom pleasing.</p>

<p>7. Chrysoberyl as usually seen is of a yellowish
green. The fine gem chrysoberyls known
as alexandrites, however, have a pleasing bluish green
or deep olive green color by daylight
and change in a most surprising fashion by
artificial light under which they show raspberry
red tints. This change, according to G. F.
Herbert-Smith, is due principally to the fact
that the balance in the spectrum of light transmitted
by the stone is so delicate that when a
light, rich in short wave lengths, falls upon
it the blue green effect is evident, whereas
when the light is rich in long wave lengths
(red end of the spectrum), the whole stone
appears red. The strong dichroism of the
species also aids this contrast. The chrysoberyls
of the cat's-eye type (of fibrous or tubular internal
structure) are usually of olive green or
brownish-green shades.</p>

<p>Those who wish to further study color distinctions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in green stones are recommended
to see the chapters on beryl (pp. 184-196),
peridot (pp. 225-227), corundum (pp. 172-183),
tourmaline (pp. 219-224), chrysoberyl (pp.
233-237), and garnet (demantoid, pp. 216-218)

<h2>LESSON XIII</h2>
<h3>COLOR&mdash;<i>Continued</i></h3>

<h4>BLUE STONES</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> species that furnish blue stones in
sufficient number to deserve consideration
are, aside from opaque stones:</p>

<div class="bq"><p>1. Corundum (sapphire).</p>

<p>2. Spinel.</p>

<p>3. Tourmaline.</p>

<p>4. Topaz.</p>

<p>5. Diamond.</p>

<p>6. Zircon.</p></div>

<p>1. Of these minerals the only species that
furnishes a fine, deep velvety blue stone is
the corundum, and fine specimens of the
cornflower blue variety are very much in
demand and command high prices. The color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in sapphires ranges from a pale watery blue
through deeper shades (often tinged with green)
to the rich velvety cornflower blue that is so
much in demand, and on to dark inky blues that
seem almost black by artificial light. Most
sapphires are better daylight stones than
evening stones. Some of the sapphires from
Montana, however, are of a bright electric blue
that is very striking and brilliant by artificial
light.</p>

<p><b>How Sapphires should be Cut.</b> The direction
in which the stone is cut helps determine the
quality of the blue color, as the "ordinary"
ray (sapphire exhibits dichroism) is yellowish
and ugly in color, and if allowed to be conspicuous
in the cut stone, its presence, blending
with the blue, may give it an undesirable greenish
cast. Sapphires should usually be cut so
that the table of the finished stone is perpendicular
to the principal optical axis of
the crystal. Another way of expressing this
fact is that the table should cross the long axis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the usual hexagonal crystal of sapphire, at
right angles. This scheme of cutting puts the
direction of single refraction up and down the
finished stone, and leaves the ugly ordinary
rays in poor position to emerge as the light that
falls upon the girdle edges cannot enter and
cross the stone to any extent.</p>

<p>To find out with a finished stone whether
or not the lapidary has cut it properly as regards
its optical properties one may use the
dichroscope, and if there is little or no dichroism
in evidence when looking through the table
of the stone it is properly cut.</p>

<p>Where a sapphire shows a poor color and
the dichroscope shows that the table was laid
improperly, there is some possibility of improving
the color by recutting to the above
indicated position. However, one must use
much judgment in such a case, as sapphires,
like other corundum gems, frequently have
their color irregularly distributed, and the
skillful lapidary will place the culet of the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in a bit of good color, and thus make the whole
stone appear to better advantage. It would not
do to alter such an arrangement, as one would
get poorer rather than better color by recutting
in such a case.</p>

<p>While some of the blue stones about to
be described may resemble inferior sapphires,
none of them approaches the better grades of
sapphire in fineness of blue coloration. The
scientific sapphire, of course, does approach
and even equals the natural sapphire so that
one must know how to distinguish between
them. This distinction is not one of color,
however, and it will be separately considered
a little later.</p>

<p>2. Blue spinels are infrequently seen in
commerce. They never equal the fine sapphire
in their color, being more steely. They,
of course, lack dichroism and are softer than
sapphire as well as lighter.</p>

<p>3. Blue tourmalines are never of fine
sapphire blue. The name indicolite which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
mineralogists give to these blue stones suggests
the indigo-blue color which they afford.
The marked dichroism of tourmaline will also
help detect it. Some tourmalines from Brazil
are of a lighter shade of blue and are sometimes
called "Brazilian sapphires."</p>

<p>4. Blue topaz is usually of a pale sky
blue or greenish blue and is likely to be confused
with beryl of similar color. The high
density of topaz (3.53) as compared with beryl
(2.74) serves best to distinguish it.</p>

<p><b>"Fancy" Blue Diamonds.</b> 5. Blue diamonds
are usually of very pale bluish or violet
tint. A few deeper blue stones are seen occasionally
as "fancy" diamonds. These are seldom
as deep blue as pale sapphires. Even the
famous Hope Blue Diamond, a stone of about
forty-four carats and of great value, is said to
be too light in color to be considered a fine
sapphire blue. Some of the deeper blue diamonds
have a steely cast. The so-called blue-white
stones are rarely blue in their body color,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but rather are so nearly white that the blue
parts of the spectra which they produce are
very much in evidence, thus causing them
to face up blue. There is little likelihood of
mistaking a bluish diamond for any other
stone on account of the "fire" and the adamantine
luster of the diamond.</p>

<p>6. Blue zircon, however, has nearly adamantine
luster and considerable fire. The
color is usually sky blue. Such stones are
seldom met with in the trade.</p>

blue stones see G. F. Herbert-Smith's

<h2>LESSON XIV</h2>
<h3>COLOR&mdash;<i>Concluded</i></h3>

<h4>PINK, PURPLE, BROWN, AND COLORLESS STONES</h4>

<p><b>Pink Stones.</b> Pink stones are yielded by (1)
corundum (pink sapphire), (2) spinel (balas
ruby), (3) tourmaline (rubellite), (4) true topaz
(almost always artificially altered), (5) beryl
(morganite), (6) spodumene (kunzite), and (7)
quartz (rose-quartz).</p>

<p>These pink minerals are not easily differentiated
by color alone, as the depth and
quality of the pink vary greatly in different
specimens of the same mineral and in
the different minerals. There is dichroism
in the cases of pink sapphire, pink tourmaline
(strong), pink topaz (strong), pink beryl
(less pronounced), and kunzite (very marked
and with a yellowish tint in some directions that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
contrasts with the beautiful violet tint in
another direction in the crystal). Pink quartz
is almost always milky, and shows little dichroism.
Pink spinel is without dichroism, being
singly refracting. Hardness and specific gravity
tests will best serve to distinguish pink stones
from each other. The color alone is not a safe
guide.</p>

<p><b>Purple Stones.</b> Among the mineral species
that furnish purple stones, (1) quartz is pre-eminent
in the fineness of the purple color.
Such purple stones are, of course, known as
amethysts. After quartz come (2) corundum
(Oriental amethyst), (3) spinel (almandine
spinel), (4) garnet (almandine), and (5) spodumene
(variety kunzite).</p>

<p>The purple of the amethyst varies from
the palest tints to the full rich velvety grape-purple
of the so-called Siberian amethysts.
The latter are of a reddish purple (sometimes
almost red) by artificial light, but of a fine violet
by daylight. No other purple stone approaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
them in fineness of coloring, so that
here we have a real distinction based on color
alone. If the purple is paler, however, one
cannot be sure of the mineral by its color. Purple
corundum (Oriental amethyst) is seldom
as fine in color as ordinary amethyst, and
never as fine as the best amethyst. It is usually
of a redder purple, and by artificial light is almost
ruby-like in its color.</p>

<p>Purple spinels are singly refracting, and lack
dichroism, and hence lack variety of color.
Almandine garnets also show no dichroism
and lack variety of color. The garnets are,
as a rule, apt to be more dense in color than
the spinels.</p>

<p>Purple spodumene (kunzite) is pinkish to
lilac in shade&mdash;usually pale, unless in large
masses, and it shows very marked dichroism.
A yellowish cast of color may be seen in certain
directions in it also, which will aid in distinguishing
it from other purple stones.</p>

<p><b>Brown Stones.</b> (1) Diamond, (2) garnet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
(3) tourmaline, and (4) zircon furnish the principal
brown stones.</p>

<p>Diamond, when brown, unless of a deep
and pleasing color, is very undesirable, as
it absorbs much light, and appears dirty
by daylight and dark and sleepy by artificial
light. When of a fine golden brown
a diamond may have considerable value as
a "fancy" stone. Such "golden fancies"
can be distinguished from other brown
stones (except perhaps brown zircons) by
their adamantine luster, and their prismatic
play or "fire."</p>

<p>Brown garnet (hessonite or cinnamon stone),
sometimes wrongly called hyacinth in the trade,
is of a deep reddish-brown color. Usually the
interior structure, as seen under a lens, is
streaky, having a sort of mixed oil and water
appearance.</p>

<p>Brown tourmaline is sometimes very pleasing
in color. It is deep in shade, less red than
cinnamon stone, and with marked dichroism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
which both brown diamond and brown garnet
lack.</p>

<p>Brown zircon, while lacking dichroism, is
frequently rich and pleasing in shade, and when
well cut is very snappy, the luster being
almost adamantine, the dispersion being large,
and the refractive index high. It is useless to
deny that by the unaided eye one might be
deceived into thinking that a fine brown zircon
was a brown diamond. However, the large
double refraction of the zircon easily distinguishes
it from diamond (use the sunlight-card
method or look for the doubling
of the edges of the rear facets as seen through
the table). The relative softness (7<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>) also
easily differentiates it from diamond.</p>

<p><b>Colorless Stones.</b> Few colorless stones other
than diamond, white sapphire (chiefly scientific),
and quartz are seen in the trade. Colorless
true topaz is sometimes sold and artificially
whitened zircon (jargoon) is also occasionally
met with. Beryl of very light green tint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
or even entirely colorless may also be seen at
times.</p>

<p>Such colorless stones must of course be
distinguished by properties other than color.
They are mentioned here merely that the
learner may be aware of what varieties of
gem minerals occur in the colorless condition,
and that all these minerals also occur with
color in their more usual forms. This does not
even except the diamond, which is rarely truly
colorless.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<h2>LESSON XV</h2>
<h3>HOW TO TELL SCIENTIFIC STONES FROM NATURAL GEMS</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> should be said first that the only true
scientific or synthetic stones on the market
are those having the composition and properties
of corundum, that is to say, the ruby and
the several color varieties of sapphire, as blue,
pink, yellow, and white. There is also a greenish
stone that appears reddish by artificial light,
which is called scientific alexandrite but which
has, however, the composition and properties
of the corundum gems rather than those of
true alexandrite. All so-called "scientific emeralds"
have proved to be either of paste of one
sort or another, or else triplets having a top
and a back of some inexpensive but hard stone
of pale color, and a central slice of deep green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
glass, the three pieces being cemented together
so skillfully that the junctions frequently escape
any but a very careful examination with a lens.</p>

<p><b>All Scientific Stones Are Corundum Gems.</b>
Now the fact that all true scientific stones
are corundum gems makes their determination
fairly simple on the following basis: Among
the considerable number of corundum gems
of nature, whether ruby or sapphire of various
colors, there is seldom found one that is entirely
free from defects. Almost always, even in
what are regarded as fine specimens, one will
easily find with a glass, defects in the crystallization.
Moreover these defects are characteristic
of the corundum gems.</p>

<p>The scientific corundum gems, however, never
have these specific defects. Hence the surest
and simplest way of distinguishing between
the two kinds of stones is to acquaint oneself
with the typical defects of natural corundum
gems, and then to look for such defects in any
specimen of ruby or sapphire that is in question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>While a description of some of the most
common of the typical defects of rubies and
sapphires is to follow, the jeweler, who may not
yet be familiar with them by actual experience,
owes it to himself and to his customers to
acquaint himself at first hand with the natural
defects of such material, which he is always
in a position to do through the courtesy of
representatives of houses dealing in precious
stones, if he himself does not carry such material
in stock.</p>

<p><b>Typical Defects of Natural Corundum Gems.</b>
Perhaps the most common of the defects of
natural corundum gems is the peculiar appearance
known as "silk." This is best seen
when a strong light is allowed to stream through
the stone at right angles to the observer's
line of sight. Sets of fine, <i>straight</i>, parallel
lines will be seen, and these will frequently meet
other sets of similar lines at an angle of 120
degrees (like the angle at which the sides of a
regular hexagon meet) or the lines may cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
each other at that angle or at an angle of 60
degrees (the supplement of 120 degrees). Such
<i>straight</i> parallel lines are never seen in scientific
stones, and their presence may be taken to
indicate positively that the stone having them
is a natural stone. In fine specimens of natural
ruby or sapphire such lines will be few and
difficult to find, but in some position or other
they will usually be found if the search is even
as careful as that which one would habitually
employ in looking for defects in a diamond.
In the vast majority of cases no such careful
search will be required to locate "silk" in
natural rubies, and if a stone that is apparently
a ruby is free from such defects it is almost a
foregone conclusion it is a scientific stone.</p>

<p>Another common type of defect in corundum
gems is the occurrence of patches of
milky cloudiness within the material. A little
actual acquaintance with the appearance of
this sort of defect in natural stones will make
it easy to distinguish from the occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
cloudiness found in scientific stones, which
latter cloudiness is due to the presence of swarms
of minute gas bubbles. These tiny bubbles
can be seen under a high power lens, and this
suggests a third feature that may be used to
tell whether one has a natural stone or not.</p>

<p>Natural rubies and sapphires, like scientific
ones, frequently contain bubbles, but
these are always <i>angular</i> in the natural stones,
while those of the scientific stones are generally
<i>round</i> or rounding, never angular.</p>

<p>To sum up the suggestions already presented
it may be said that, since natural and
scientific corundum gems are composed of
essentially the same material, and have identically
the same physical and chemical properties,
and frequently very closely resemble each other
in color, it is necessary to have recourse to some
other means of distinguishing between them.
The best and simplest means for those who are
acquainted with the structural defects common
to natural corundum gems is to seek for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
defects in any specimen that is in question, and
if no such defects can be found, to be very
sceptical as to the naturalness of the specimen,
inasmuch as perfect corundum gems
are very rare in nature, and when of fine color
command exceedingly high prices. No jeweler
can afford to risk his reputation for knowledge
and for integrity by selling as a natural stone
any gem which does not possess the minor
defects common to practically all corundum
gems.</p>

<p><b>Structural Defects of Scientific Stones.</b> So
far our tests have been mostly negative. It
was said, however, that spherical bubbles sometimes
appear in scientific gems. Another characteristic
<i>structural</i> defect of practically every
scientific gem may be utilized to distinguish
them. As is well known, the rough material is
formed in boules or pear-shaped drops under
an inverted blowpipe. The powdered material
is fed in with one of the gases and passes through
the flame, melting as it goes, and then accumulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and crystallizing below as a boule. The
top or head of this boule is rounding from
the start, and hence the successive layers of
material gather in thin curved zones. The color
and structure of these successive zones are not
perfectly uniform, hence when cut stones are
made from the boules these <i>curving</i> parallel
layers may be seen within by the use of a good
lens, especially if the cut stone is held in a
strong crossing light, as was suggested when
directions were given above as to the best way
to look for "silk" in a natural stone.</p>

<p>Owing to the shape of a well cut stone it
is sometimes difficult to get light through the
material, yet by turning the stone repeatedly,
some position will be found in which the curving
parallel stri&aelig; can be seen. They are easily
seen in scientific ruby, less easily in dark blue
sapphire, but still they can be found on close
search. In the light colored stones and in white
sapphire, the difficulty is greater, as there
are no color variations in the latter case. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the value of white sapphire is so slight,
whether natural or artificial, that it is a matter
of but little moment, and what has already
been said as to natural defects, applies to white
sapphire as well as to the colored varieties, and
absolutely clear and perfect natural white
sapphire is rare.</p>

<p>One more distinguishing mark of the scientific
stones may be added to give full measure to
the scheme of separation, that no one need be
deceived.</p>

<p>The surface finish of the scientific stones
is rarely as good as that of the natural material
and it appears to be more difficult to produce
a good polish on scientific stones than on
natural ones. The degree of hardness of the
scientific stones seems to be slightly variable
in different parts of the same piece so that the
polishing material removes the surface material
unequally, leaving minute streaky marks on
the surfaces of the facets. Possibly this
condition might be remedied by skillful treatment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
but hardly at the price obtainable for the
product, so that a close study of the surface
finish will sometimes help in distinguishing
between natural and artificial material. Any
fine specimen of natural ruby or sapphire will
have usually received very expert treatment and
a splendid surface finish.</p>

<p>In conclusion, then, the points to be remembered
in determining the origin of
corundum gems are four in number.</p>

<p>1. Expect to find natural defects, such
as "silk" or cloudy patches, or <i>angular</i> bubbles
in all natural stones.</p>

<p>2. If bubbles are present in artificial
material they will be <i>round</i> or rounding.</p>

<p>3. Artificial material will always have
<i>curving</i> parallel stri&aelig; within it.</p>

<p>4. The <i>surface finish</i> of artificial material
is seldom or never equal to that of natural
material.</p>

<p>It ought not to be necessary to add that
material from either source may be cut to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
any shape, and that artificial rubies may
be seen in most Oriental garb, hence all specimens
should have applied to them the above
tests regardless of the seeming antiquity of their
cut or of their alleged pedigree.</p>

<h2>LESSON XVI</h2>
<h3>HOW TO TEST AN "UNKNOWN" GEM</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Having</span> now considered separately the
principal physical properties by means
of which one can identify a precious stone,
let us attempt to give as good an idea as the
printed page can convey of how one should go
about determining to what species a gem belongs.</p>

<p><b>Signs of Wear in an Emerald.</b> To make the
matter more concrete, and therefore more
interesting, let us consider a real case, the most
recent problem, in fact, that the author has had
to solve. A lady of some wealth had purchased,
for a large sum, a green stone which purported
to be an emerald. After a few years of wear as
a ring stone she noticed one day that the
stone had dulled around the edges of its table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and thinking that that ought not to be the
case with a real emerald, she appealed to a
dealer in diamonds to know if her stone was a
real emerald. The diamond merchant told
her frankly that, while he was competent in all
matters pertaining to diamonds, he could not
be sure of himself regarding colored stones,
and advised the lady to see the author.</p>

<p>The matter being thus introduced, the lady
was at once informed that even a real emerald
might show signs of wear after a few years
of the hard use that comes to a ring stone.</p>

<p>While emerald has, as we saw in the lesson on
hardness, a degree of hardness rated as nearly
8 (7<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> in the table), it is nevertheless a rather
brittle material and the long series of tiny blows
that a ring stone is bound to meet with will cause
minute yielding along the exposed edges and
corners of the top facets. This being announced,
the first step in the examination of
the stone was to clean it and to give it a
careful examination with a ten-power lens. (An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
aplanatic triplet will be found best for this
purpose.)</p>

<p><b>Color.</b> The color was, of course, the most
obvious property, but, as has already been said,
color is not to be relied upon in all cases. In
this case the color was a good emerald green but
a bit bluer than the finest grass green. A very
fine Maine tourmaline might approach this
stone in color, so it became necessary to consider
this possibility. A glass imitation, too, might
have a color equal or superior to this.</p>

<p><b>Imperfections.</b> While noting the color, the
imperfections of the stone claimed attention.
They consisted mainly of minute jagged cracks
of the character peculiar to brittle materials
such as both emerald and tourmaline. So
far it will be noted either of the above minerals
might have furnished the lady's gem. As glass
can be artificially crackled to produce similar
flaws the stone might have been only an imitation
as far as anything yet learned about it
goes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><b>File Test.</b> The next step was to test its
hardness by gently applying a very fine file to
an exposed point at one corner of the girdle.
The file slipped on the material as a skate
slips on ice. Evidently we did not have to
do with a glass imitation.</p>

<p><b>Refraction.</b> Knowing now that we had a
true hard mineral, it remained to be determined
what mineral it was. On holding the stone in
direct sunlight and reflecting the light onto a
white card it was seen at once that the material
was doubly refracting, for a series of
<i>double</i> images of the back facets appeared.
These double images might have been produced
by tourmaline as well as by emerald. (Not however
by glass which is singly refracting.) If a
direct reading refractometer had been available
the matter could have been settled at once
by reading the refractive indices of the material,
for tourmaline and emerald have not only
different refractive indices but have double
refraction to different degrees. Such an instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was not available at the time and will
hardly be available to most of those who are
studying this lesson, so we can go on with our
account of the further testing of the green stone.</p>

<p><b>Hardness.</b> A test upon the surface of a
quartz crystal showed that the stone was harder
than quartz (but so is tourmaline). A true
topaz crystal was too hard for the ring stone,
whose edge slipped over the smooth topaz
surface. The green stone was therefore not a
green corundum (Oriental emerald) as the latter
has hardness 9 and scratches topaz.</p>

<p>With hardness evidently between 7 and
8 and with double refraction and with the kind
of flaws peculiar to rather brittle minerals we
had in all probability either a tourmaline or
an emerald.</p>

<p><b>Dichroism.</b> The dichroscope (which might
have been used much earlier in the test but was
not at hand at the time) was next tried and
the stone was seen to have marked dichroism&mdash;a
bluish green and a yellowish green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
appearing in the two squares of the instrument
when the stone was held in front of the
opening and viewed against a strong light.</p>

<p>As either tourmaline or emerald might
thus exhibit dichroism (the tourmaline more
strongly, however, than the emerald) one more
test was tried to finally decide the matter.</p>

<p><b>Specific Gravity.</b> The stone was removed
from its setting and two specific gravity determinations
made by means of a specific gravity
bottle and a fine chemical balance. The
two results, which came closely alike, averaged
2.70 which agrees very nearly with emerald
(2.74) and which is far removed from
the specific gravity of tourmaline (3.10).
The stone was now <i>definitely known</i> to
be an emerald, as each of several tests agreed
with the properties of emerald, namely:</p>

<div class="bq"><p>Color&mdash;nearly grass green.</p>

<p>Imperfections&mdash;like those of emerald.</p>

<p>Hardness&mdash;7<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>.</p>

<p>Refraction&mdash;double.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Dichroism&mdash;easily noted.</p>

<p>Specific gravity&mdash;2.70.</p></div>

<p>While one who was accustomed to deal
in fine emeralds might not need to make as
detailed an examination of the stone as has just
been indicated above, yet for most of us who
do not have many opportunities of studying
valuable emeralds it is safer to make sure by
complete tests.</p>

<p>One other concrete example of how to go
about testing unknown stones must suffice
to conclude this lesson, after which the student,
who has mastered the separate lessons preceding
this, should proceed to test as many "unknowns"
as his time and industry permit in
order to really make <i>his own</i> the matter of these
lessons. It may be added here that the task
of testing a stone is much more rapid than this
laborious effort to teach others how to do it
might indicate. To one skilled in these matters
only a few seconds are required for the inspection
of a stone with the lens, the dichroscope, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
refractometer, and hardness tests are swiftly
made. A specific gravity test requires more
time and should be resorted to only when there
remains a reasonable doubt after other tests
have been applied.</p>

<p>Now for our final example. A red stone,
cut in the form of a pear-shaped brilliant,
was submitted to the writer for determination.
It had been acquired by an American
gentleman in Japan from an East Indian
who was in financial straits. Along with it,
as security for a loan, the American obtained a
number of smaller red stones, a bluish stone, and
a larger red stone. The red stones were all
supposed to be rubies. On examination of
the larger red stone with a lens it was at once
noted that the internal structure was that of
<i>scientific ruby</i>.</p>

<p><b>Testing Other Stones.</b> Somewhat dashed by
the announcement of this discovery the owner
began to fear that all his gems were false.
Examination of the small red stones showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
abundance of "silk," a peculiar fibrous appearance
within the stone caused by its internal
structure. The fibers were <i>straight</i> and <i>parallel</i>,
not <i>curved</i> and <i>parallel</i> as in synthetic ruby.
Tiny bubbles of angular shape also indicated
that the small stones were natural rubies.
They exhibited dichroism and scratched topaz
and it was therefore decided that they at
least were genuine.</p>

<p>The pear-shaped brilliant which was first
mentioned was of a peculiar, slightly yellowish,
red color. It was very pellucid and free from
any stri&aelig; either of the straight or curved types.
It had in fact no flaws except a rather large nick
on one of the back surfaces near the girdle.
This was not in evidence from the front of the
stone and had evidently been left by the
Oriental gem cutter to avoid loss in weight
while cutting the stone.</p>

<p>The peculiar yellowish character of the
red color led us to suspect ruby spinel. The
stone was therefore inspected with the dichroscope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and found to possess no dichroism.
The sunlight-card test, too, showed that the
stone was singly refracting.</p>

<p>A test of the hardness showed that the
material barely scratched topaz, but was
attacked by sapphire. It was therefore judged
to be a red spinel.</p>

<p>The large bluish stone which the gentleman
acquired with the red stones proved to be
iolite, sometimes called cordierite or water-sapphire
(<i>Saphir d'eau</i>), a stone seldom seen
in this country. It had marked dichroism&mdash;showing
a smoky blue color in one direction and
a yellowish white in another. The difference
was so marked as to be easily seen without the
dichroscope.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<h2>LESSON XVII</h2>
<h3>SUITABILITY OF STONES FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF
JEWELS, AS DETERMINED BY HARDNESS,
BRITTLENESS, AND CLEAVABILITY</h3>

<p><b>Hard Stones not Necessarily Tough.</b> As
was suggested in the lesson on hardness there
is prevalent in the public mind an erroneous
belief that hardness carries with it ability
to resist blows as well as abrasion. Now that
<i>it does not follow that because a precious stone is
very hard, it will wear well</i>, should be made plain.
Some rather hard minerals are seldom or
never used as gems, in spite of considerable
beauty and hardness, because of their great
brittleness. Other stones, while fairly hard
and reasonably tough in certain directions,
have nevertheless so pronounced a cleavage
that they do not wear well if cut, and are
sometimes very difficult to cut at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>In view of these facts it will be well to consider
briefly what stones, among those most in
use, are sufficiently tough as well as hard,
to give good service in jewels, such as rings,
which are subject to rough wear. We may
also consider those stones, whose softness, or
brittleness, or ready cleavability, requires that
they should be reserved for use only in those
jewels which, because of their nature, receive less
rough usage.</p>

<p>In order to deal with the principal gems
systematically, let us consider them in the
order of their hardness, beginning with the
hardest gem material known, which is, of
course, diamond.</p>

<p><b>Durability of the Diamond.</b> Fortunately
this king of gems possesses in addition to its
great hardness, considerable toughness, and
although it is readily cleavable in certain directions
it nevertheless requires a notable amount
of force applied in a particular direction to
cause it to cleave. Although sharp knocks will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
occasionally flake off thin layers from diamonds
when roughly worn in rings, or even in extreme
cases fracture them, yet this happens but seldom
and, as the enormous use of the diamond in ring
mountings proves, it is entirely suitable for that
purpose. It follows that, if a stone can stand
ring usage, it can safely be used for any purpose
for which precious stones are mounted.</p>

<p><b>The Corundum Gems.</b> Next after the diamond
in hardness come the corundum gems, <i>i. e.</i>,
ruby, sapphire, and the series of corundum gems
of colors other than red and blue. These
stones have no noticeable cleavage and are
exceedingly tough, for minerals, as well as
very hard. We have only to consider the
use of impure corundum (emery) as a commercial
abrasive in emery wheels, emery cloth,
emery paper, etc., to see that the material is
tough. Any of the corundum gems therefore
may be used in any type of jewel without
undue risk of wear or breakage. Customers of
jewelers should, however, be cautioned against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
wearing ruby or sapphire rings on the same
finger with a diamond ring in cases where it
would be possible for the two stones to rub
against each other. So much harder than
the ruby is the diamond (in spite of the seeming
closeness of position in Mohs's scale) that
the slightest touch upon a ruby surface with a
diamond will produce a pronounced scratch.
The possessor of diamonds and other stones
should also be cautioned against keeping them
loose in the same jewel case or other container, as
the shaking together may result in the scratching
of the softer materials. The Arabs are
said to have a legend to the effect that the
diamond is an <i>angry</i> stone and that it should
not be allowed to associate with other stones
lest it scratch them.</p>

<p><b>Chrysoberyl.</b> Passing on to the next mineral
in the scale of hardness we come to chrysoberyl,
which is rated as 8<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> on Mohs's scale. This
mineral furnishes us the gem, alexandrite,
which is notable for its power to change in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
color from green in daylight to red in artificial
light. Chrysoberyl also supplies the
finest cat's-eyes (when the material is of a sufficiently
fibrous or tubular structure), and it
further supplies the greenish-yellow stones
frequently (though incorrectly) called "chrysolite"
by jewelers. The material is very hard
and reasonably tough and may be used in almost
any suitable mounting.</p>

<p><b>Spinel.</b> After chrysoberyl come the materials
rated as about 8 in hardness. First and
hardest of these is spinel, then comes true
or precious topaz. The various spinels are
very hard and tough stones. The rough
material persists in turbulent mountain streams
where weaker minerals are ground to powder,
and when cut and polished, spinel will wear
well in any jewel. The author has long worn a
ruby spinel in a ring on the right hand and has
done many things that have subjected it to hard
knocks, yet it is still intact, except for a spot
that accidentally came in contact with a fast-flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
carborundum wheel, which of course
abraded the spinel.</p>

<p><b>Topaz.</b> The true topaz is a bit softer than
spinel, and the rough crystals show a very perfect
basal cleavage. That is, they will cleave
in a plane parallel to the bases of the usual
orthorhombic crystals. This being the case
a cut topaz is very likely to be damaged by
a blow or even by being dropped on a hard
surface, and it would be wiser not to set such a
stone in a ring unless it was to be but little
used, or used by one who would not engage
in rough work while wearing it. Thus a lady
might wear a topaz ring on dress occasions for a
long time without damaging it, but it would not
do for a machinist to wear one in a ring.</p>

<p><b>Gems between 7 and 8 in Hardness.</b> We
now come to a rather long list of gem minerals
ranging between 7 and 8 in hardness. Of these
the principal ones are zircon, almandine garnet,
and beryl (emerald and aquamarine) rated as
7<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> in hardness, and pyrope and hessonite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
garnet rated as 7<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span> in hardness. Tourmaline
and kunzite may also be included in this group
as being on the average slightly above 7 in
hardness.</p>

<p>The above minerals are all harder than
quartz, and hence not subject to abrasion
by the quartz dust which is everywhere present.
In this respect they are suitable for fairly hard
wear. The garnets are of sufficient toughness
so that they may be freely used in rings&mdash;and
the extensive use of thin slices of garnet
to top doublets proves the suitability of the
material for resisting wear. The zircon is
rather more brittle and the artificially whitened
zircons (known as jargoons) are especially subject
to breakage when worn in rings. Fortunately
jargoons are not commonly sold.</p>

<p>The beryl, whether emerald or aquamarine,
is rather brittle. Emeralds are seldom found in
river gravels. The material cannot persist in
the mountain streams that bring down other
and tougher minerals. The extreme beauty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
value of the emerald has led to its use in the
finest jewels, and the temptation is strong to set
it in rings, especially in rings for ladies. If such
rings are worn with the care that valuable jewels
should receive they will probably last a long time
without any more serious damage than the
dulling of the sharp edges of the facets around
the table. This slight damage can at any time
be repaired by a light repolishing of the affected
facets. If an emerald is already badly shattered,
or as it is called "mossy" in character,
it will not be wise to set it in a ring, as a slight
shock might complete its fracture. What
has been said about emerald applies equally
to aquamarine except that the value at stake
is much less and the material is usually much
freer from cracks.</p>

<p>Tourmalines, like emeralds, are brittle, and
should be treated accordingly. Here, however,
we are dealing with a much less expensive material
than emerald, and if a customer desires a
tourmaline in a ring mounting, while it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
best to suggest care in wearing it, the loss, in
case of breakage, will usually be slight.</p>

<p>Kunzite, like all spodumene, has a pronounced
cleavage. It should therefore be
used in brooches, pendants, and such jewels,
rather than in rings. Lapidaries dislike to
cut it under some conditions because of its
fragility.</p>

<p><b>Quartz Gems.</b> Coming down to hardness 7
we have the various quartz gems and jade (variety
jadeite). The principal quartz gems are, of
course, amethyst and citrine quartz (the stone
that is almost universally called topaz in the
trade). As crystalline quartz is fairly tough and
lacks any pronounced cleavage, and as it is as
hard as anything it is likely to meet with in use,
it is a durable stone in rings or in other mountings.
In the course of time the sharp edges will
wear dull from friction with objects carrying
common dust, which is largely composed of powdered
quartz itself, and which therefore gradually
dulls a quartz gem. Old amethysts or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
"topazes" that have been long in use in rings
show this dulling. There is, however, little
danger of fracture with amethyst or "topaz"
unless the blow is severe and then any stone
might yield.</p>

<p>The many semi-precious stones which have
a quartz basis (such as the varieties of waxy
or cryptocrystalline chalcedony which is largely
quartz in a very minutely crystalline condition)
are often even tougher than the clear crystallized
quartz. Carnelian, agate, quartz cat's-eye,
jasper (containing earthy impurities), and those
materials in which quartz has more or less
completely replaced other substances, such as
silicified crocidolite, petrified wood, chrysocolla
quartz, etc., are all nearly as hard and quite as
tough as quartz itself, and they make admirable
stones for inexpensive rings of the arts and
crafts type.</p>

<p><b>Jade.</b> Jade, of the jadeite variety, which is
rarer than the nephrite jade, and more highly
regarded by the Chinese, is an exceedingly tough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
material. One can beat a chunk of the rough
material with a hammer without making much
impression upon it. It is also fairly hard,
about as hard as quartz, and with the two
properties of toughness and hardness it possesses
excellent wearing qualities in any kind of
mounting. True jade, whether jadeite or
nephrite, deserves a larger use in inexpensive
ornaments, as it may be had of very fine green
color and it is inexpensive and durable.</p>

<p><b>Softer Stones.</b> Coming next to those minerals
whose hardness is 6 or over, but less than
7, we have to consider jade of the nephrite
variety, demantoid garnet ("olivine" of the
trade), peridot (or chrysolite, or the olivine of
the mineralogist), turquoise, moonstone, and
opal.</p>

<p>As has already been said of jadeite, the
jade of the nephrite variety, while slightly
less hard, is about as tough a mineral as one
could expect to find. It can take care of itself
in any situation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The demantoid garnet (the "olivine" of
the trade) is so beautiful and brilliant a stone
that it is a pity that it is so lacking in hardness.
It will do very well for mounting in such jewels
as scarf pins, lavalli&egrave;res, etc., where but little
hard wear is met with, but it cannot be recommended
for hard ring use.</p>

<p>The peridot, too, is rather soft for ring use
and will last much better in scarf pins or other
mountings little subject to rubbing or to shocks.</p>

<p>Turquoise, although rather soft, is fairly
tough, as its waxy luster might make one
suppose, and in addition, being an opaque
stone, slight dulling or scratching hardly
lessens its beauty. It may therefore be used
in ring mountings. However, it should be
suggested that most turquoise is sufficiently
porous to absorb grease, oil, or other liquids,
and its color is frequently ruined thereby. Of
course, such a change is far more likely to occur
to a ring stone than to a turquoise mounted
in some more protected situation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The moonstone, being a variety of feldspar,
has the pronounced cleavage of that mineral
and will not stand blows without exhibiting
this property. Moonstones are therefore better
suited to the less rude service in brooch mountings,
etc., than to that of ring stones. However,
being comparatively inexpensive, many
moonstones, especially of the choicer bluish
type, are set in ring mountings. The lack of
hardness may be expected to dull their surfaces
in time even though no shock starts a cleavage.</p>

<p><b>The Opal.</b> There remains the opal, of hardness
6, to be considered. As is well known opal
is a solidified jelly of siliceous composition,
containing also combined water. It is not
only soft but very brittle and it will crack
very easily. Many opals crack in the paper
in which they are sold, perhaps because of
unequal expansion or contraction, due to heat or
cold. In spite of this fragility, thousands of
fine opals, and a host of commoner ones, are set
in rings, where many of them subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
come to a violent end, and all, sooner or later,
become dulled and require repolishing.</p>

<p>The great beauty of the opal, rivaling any
mineral in its color-play, causes us to chance
the risk of damage in order to mount it where
its vivid hues may be advantageously viewed
by the wearer as well as by others.</p>

<p><b>Very Soft Stones.</b> Of stones softer than 6 we
have but few and none of them is really fit for
hard service. Lapis lazuli, 5<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> in hardness, has
a beautiful blue color, frequently flecked with
white or with bits of fool's gold. Its surface
soon becomes dulled by hard wear.</p>

<p>Two more of the softer materials, malachite
and azurite, remain to be described. These
are both varieties of copper carbonate with
combined water, the azurite having less water.
Both take a good polish, but fail to retain it in
use, being only of hardness 3<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> to 4.</p>

<h3>MINERAL SPECIES TO WHICH THE VARIOUS GEMS
BELONG AND THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
THEREOF</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Although</span> we have a very large number
of different kinds of precious and semi-precious
stones, to judge by the long list
of names to be found in books on gems, yet all
these stones can be rather simply classified on
the basis of their chemical composition, into
one or another of a comparatively small number
of mineral species. While jewelers seldom
make use of a knowledge of the chemistry of the
precious stones in identifying them, nevertheless
such a knowledge is useful, both by way of
information, and because it leads to a better
and clearer understanding of the many
similarities among stones whose color might
lead one to regard them as dissimilar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mineral Species.</b> We must first consider
what is meant by a "mineral species" and find
out what relation exists between that subject
and chemical composition. Now by a "mineral
species" is understood a single substance,
having (except for mechanically admixed
impurities) practically a constant chemical
composition, and having practically identical
physical properties in all specimens of it.</p>

<p><b>Diamond and Corundum.</b> A chemist would
call a true mineral a <i>pure substance</i>, just as sugar
and salt are pure substances to the chemist.
Thus <i>diamond</i> is a "mineral species," as is also
<i>corundum</i>. There are many different colors
of both diamond and corundum, but these
different colors are believed to be due to the
presence in the pure substance of impurities in
small amounts. Thus every diamond consists
mainly of pure carbon, and all the corundum
gems (<i>ruby</i> and the various colors of <i>sapphire</i>)
consist mainly of pure oxide of aluminum. The
properties of all diamonds are practically alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and so are the properties of all the corundum
gems whether red (ruby), blue (sapphire),
yellow (Oriental topaz), green (Oriental
emerald), or purple (Oriental amethyst).</p>

<p>Thus all diamonds, of whatever color, belong
to the one species, diamond, and in this
case the usual custom in naming them agrees
with the facts. Similarly all sapphires, of
whatever color, belong to the mineral species
"corundum." Thus a ruby is a red corundum.</p>

<p>The old French traveler and gem merchant,
Tavernier, tells us that in the seventeenth century,
when he visited the mines of Pegu, the natives
knew of the similarity of the corundum
gems and even called all by one name, with other
names attached to designate the color. Singularly
enough, the common name used by them
was <i>ruby</i> rather than sapphire, as now. Thus
they called blue corundum gems blue rubies;
yellow corundums, yellow rubies, etc.</p>

<p>It is easily seen that if one recognizes the
similar nature of all the many colors and shades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of corundum that the number of things that one
has to remember in order to be well acquainted
with these stones is considerably diminished.
Thus, instead of having a whole series of specific
gravities to remember one has only to remember
that all the corundum gems have a specific
gravity of approximately 4. Similarly they
are all of practically the same refractive index
(1.761-1.770, being doubly refracting) that
they all exhibit dichroism when at all deeply
colored, etc.</p>

<p>Having thus indicated what we mean by
mineral species and having illustrated the
matter by the cases of diamond and corundum
and further having stated that all diamonds
are composed of pure carbon (except
for traces of impurities) and all corundum gems
mainly of oxide of aluminum, we may proceed
to consider other mineral species and find out
what gems they afford us.</p>

<p><b>Carbon, the only Element Furnishing a Gem.</b>
It will be noted that the first species considered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
diamond, consisted of but a single
element, carbon. It is thus exceedingly simple
in composition, being not only a pure substance
but, in addition, an elementary substance.
<b>Corundum</b>, the second species considered, was
a little more complex, having two elements,
aluminum and oxygen, in its make-up, but
completely and definitely combined in a new
compound that resembles neither aluminum nor
oxygen. It is thus a compound substance.
No other element than carbon affords any
gem-stone when by itself.</p>

<p><b>Oxides of Metals.</b> There is, however, another
oxide, in addition to aluminum oxide,
that furnishes gem material. It is <i>silicon oxide</i>,
containing the two elements silicon and oxygen.
Silicon itself is a dark, gray, crystalline element
that seems half metallic, half non-metallic
in its properties. It is never found by itself
in nature but about twenty-eight per cent. of
the crust of the earth is composed of it in compound
forms, and one of the most abundant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
these is <b>quartz</b>, which is a mineral species, and
which contains just silicon and oxygen. That
is, it is oxide of silicon. Now quartz is colorless
when pure (<i>rock crystal</i>), but it is frequently
found colored purple (probably by oxide of
manganese) and it is then called <i>amethyst</i>
by the jeweler. At other times its color is
yellow (due to oxide of iron) and then the
jeweler is prone to call it "<i>topaz</i>," although
properly speaking that name should, as we shall
soon see, be reserved for an entirely different
mineral species. <i>Chalcedony</i> too (which when
banded furnishes us our <i>agates</i>, and when reddish
our <i>carnelian</i>) is a variety of quartz, and
<i>prase</i> is only quartz colored green by fibers of
actinolite within it.</p>

<p>The common <i>cat's-eye</i> and the <i>tiger's-eye</i> are
varieties of quartz enclosing fibrous minerals or
replacing them while still keeping the arrangement
that they had. "<i>Venus hair stone</i>" is
quartz containing needle-like crystals of rutile,
and "<i>iris</i>" is quartz that has been crackled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
within, so as to produce rainbow colors, because
of the effects of thin layers of material. <i>Aventurine
quartz</i> (sometimes called goldstone) has
spangles of mica or of some other mineral
enclosed in it. The <i>jaspers</i> are mainly quartz
with more of earthy impurity than the preceding
stones.</p>

<p>Thus all this long list of stones of differing
names can be classified under the one
mineral species, quartz. Together they constitute
the quartz gems. In properties they are
essentially alike, having specific gravity 2.66,
hardness 7, slight double refraction, etc., the
slight differences that exist being due only to the
presence of varying amounts of foreign matter.</p>

<p><b>Opal.</b> The <i>opal</i> may be considered along
with the quartz gems, because, like them, it
is composed mainly of oxide of silicon, but
the opal also has water combined with the
silicon oxide (not merely imprisoned in it).
Thus opal is a hydrous form of silica (hydrous
comes from the Greek word for water).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Spinel.</b> All our other stones are of more complicated
chemical composition than the preceding.
Coming now to mineral species which
have three chemical elements in them we may
consider first <i>spinel</i>, which has the two metallic
elements aluminum and magnesium and the
non-metallic element oxygen in it. It is
virtually a compound of the two oxides, aluminum
oxide and magnesium oxide. The variously
colored spinels, like the various corundums,
all have the same properties, thus they are
all of hardness 8 or a little higher, they all
have single refraction, and all have specific
gravity 3.60.</p>

<p><b>Chrysoberyl.</b> Another mineral species which,
like spinel, has just three elements in its composition
is <i>chrysoberyl</i>. This mineral contains
the metals aluminum and beryllium
combined with the non-metal oxygen. Thus
it is really to be regarded as a compound of the
two oxides, aluminum oxide and beryllium oxide.
This species furnishes us <i>Alexandrite</i>, <i>chrysoberyl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
cat's-eye</i> and less valuable chrysoberyls of yellowish-green
color. All are of the one species,
the marked color difference being due to the
presence of different impurities. The cat's-eye
effect in one of the varieties is due to the
internal structure rather than to the nature of
the material.</p>

<p><b>The Silicates.</b> Nearly all of the remaining
precious stones belong to a great group of
mineral species known as the silicates. These
are so called because they consist largely of
oxide of silicon (the material above referred to
under quartz gems). This oxide of silicon is not
free and separate in the silicates but is combined
chemically with other oxides, chiefly with
metallic oxides. Thus there are many different
silicates because, in the earth, many different
metallic oxides have combined with silicon
oxide. Also in many cases two or three or
even more metallic oxides have combined with
silicon oxide to make single new compounds.</p>

<p><b>Glass, a Mixture of Silicates.</b> Those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
familiar with glass making may receive some
help at this point by remembering that the
various glasses are silicates, for they are made
by melting sand (which is nearly pure oxide of
silicon) with various metallic oxides. With
lime (calcium oxide) and soda (which yields
sodium oxide) we get soda-lime glass (common
window glass). Lead oxide being added to the
mixture a dense, very brilliant, but soft glass
(flint glass) results. Cut glass dishes and
"paste" gems are made of this flint glass. Now
the glasses, although they are silicates, are not
crystalline, but rather they are <i>amorphous</i>,
that is, without any definite structure. Nature's
silicates, on the other hand, are usually
crystallized or at least crystalline in structure.
(In a few cases we find true glasses, volcanic
glass, or obsidian, for example.)</p>

<p>Having thus introduced the silicates we
may now consider which ones among the
many mineral silicates furnish us with precious
or semi-precious stones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Beryl, Emerald, and Aquamarine.</b> First in
value among the silicates is <i>beryl</i>, which, when
grass green, we call <i>emerald</i>. The <i>aquamarine</i>
and <i>golden beryl</i> too belong to this same species.
Beryl is a silicate of aluminum and beryllium.
That is, it is a compound in which oxide of
silicon is united with the oxides of aluminum
and of beryllium. There are thus four chemical
elements combined in the one substance and it
is hence more complicated in its composition
than any of the gems that we have yet considered.
It is worthy of note that aluminum
occurs in the majority of precious stones, the
only species so far considered that lack it being
diamond, and the quartz gems.</p>

<p>Perhaps the silicates that are next in importance
to the jeweler, after beryl, are those
which form the <i>garnets</i> of various types. There
are four principal varieties of garnet (although
specimens of garnet frequently show a crossing
or blending of the types).</p>

<p><b>Garnets.</b> The types are (1) <i>Almandite</i> garnet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
(2) <i>Pyrope</i> garnet; (3) <i>Hessonite</i> garnet;
and (4) <i>Andradite</i> garnet. These are all
silicates, the almandite garnets being silicates
of iron and aluminum; the pyrope garnets are
silicates of magnesium and aluminum; the
hessonite garnets, silicates of calcium and
aluminum, and the andradite garnets, silicates
of calcium and iron.</p>

<p>The so-called almandine garnets of the
jeweler are frequently of the almandite class
and tend to purplish red. The pyrope garnets
are, as the name literally implies, of fire red
color, as a rule, but they also may be purplish
in color. The hessonite garnets are frequently
brownish red and are sometimes called "cinnamon
stones." The andradite garnets furnish
the brilliant, nearly emerald green demantoids
(so often called "<i>olivine</i>" by the trade).</p>

<p>Thus all the garnets are silicates and yet we
have these four principal mineral species, which,
however, are more closely related to each other
in crystal form, in character of composition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in general properties, than is usual among the
other silicates. Specimens which have any
one of the four types of composition unblended
with any of the other types would be found to
be exactly alike in properties. As was suggested
above, however, there is a great tendency
to blend and this is well illustrated by the
magnificent <i>rhodolite</i> garnets, of rhododendron
hue which were found in Macon County, North
Carolina. These had a composition between
almandite and pyrope, that is, they had both
magnesium and iron with aluminum and
silica.</p>

<p>The true <b>topaz</b> next calls for consideration
as it too is a silicate. The metallic part
consists of aluminum, and there are present
also the non-metals fluorine and hydrogen.
Here we have five elements in the one substance.
Various specimens of this species may
be wine yellow, light blue, or bluish green,
pink or colorless, yet they all have essentially
the same properties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Tourmaline</b> is about as complicated a mineral
as we have. It is a very complex silicate,
containing aluminum, magnesium, sodium (or
other alkali metal, as, for example, lithium),
iron, boron, and hydrogen. As Ruskin says
of it in his <i>The Ethics of the Dust</i>, when Mary
asks "and what is it made of?" "A little of
everything; there's always flint (silica) and clay
(alumina) and magnesia in it and the black
is iron, according to its fancy; and there's
boracic acid, if you know what that is: and if
you don't, I cannot tell you to-day and it
doesn't signify; and there's potash and soda;
and on the whole, the chemistry of it is more like
a medi&aelig;val doctor's prescription, than the making
of a respectable mineral." The various
tourmalines very closely resemble each other
in their properties, the slight differences corresponding
to differences in composition do not
alter the general nature of the material.</p>

<p><b>Moonstone</b> belongs to a species of mineral
known as feldspar. The particular feldspar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
that furnishes most of the moonstone is orthoclase,
a silicate of potassium and aluminum.
Another feldspar sometimes seen as a semi-precious
stone is <i>Labradorite</i>. <i>Amazonite</i>, also,
is a feldspar. <i>Sunstone</i> is a feldspar which
includes tiny flakes or spangles of some other
mineral.</p>

<p>The mineral species <i>olivine</i> gives us <i>peridot</i>.
It is a silicate of magnesium.</p>

<p><b>Zircon</b> is itself a species of mineral and
is a silicate of zirconium. The names <i>hyacinth</i>,
<i>jacinth</i>, and <i>jargoon</i> are applied to
red, yellow, and colorless zircon in the order
as given.</p>

<p><b>Jade</b> may be of any of several different
species of minerals, all of which are very tough.
The principal jades belong, however, to one or
the other of two species, <i>jadeite</i> and <i>nephrite</i>.
Jadeite is a sodium aluminum silicate and
nephrite, a calcium magnesium silicate.</p>

<p>Leaving the silicates we find very few gem
minerals remaining. The phosphates furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
us <i>turquoise</i>, a hydrous aluminum phosphate,
with copper and iron. <i>Variscite</i> is also a phosphate
(a hydrated aluminum phosphate).</p>

<p>The carbonates give us <i>malachite</i> and <i>azurite</i>,
both carbonates of copper with combined
water, the malachite having more water.</p>

<h2>LESSON XIX</h2>

<h3>THE NAMING OF PRECIOUS STONES</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Owing</span> to the confusion which may result
from a lack of uniformity in the naming
of precious stones, it is very desirable that
jewelers and stone merchants inform themselves
in regard to the correct use of the names
of the gems, and that they use care in speaking
and in writing such names.</p>

<p>As nearly all precious and semi-precious
stones are derived from a relatively small
number of <i>mineral species</i>, as we saw in <a href="#LESSON_XVIII">Lesson
XVIII.</a>, and as the science of <i>mineralogy</i> has
a very orderly and systematic method of naming
the minerals, the best results are had in the naming
of gems when we use, as far as is possible,
the language of mineralogy.</p>

<p><b>Ancient Usage.</b> Long established custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and usage, however, must be observed, for any
system of naming must be generally understood
in order to be useful. Thus the proper
name for blood red, crystallized oxide of aluminum,
of gem quality, according to the mineralogical
system of naming, would be red
<i>corundum</i>, but that same material is referred
to in the Old Testament thus (in speaking of
wisdom), "She is more precious than <i>rubies</i>."
It is obviously necessary to keep and to use all
such terms as have been for years established
in usage, even though they do not agree with
the scientific method of naming the particular
mineral. It is, however, necessary that any
name, thus retained, should be correctly used,
and that it should not be applied to more than
one material. Thus the term <i>ruby</i> should be
reserved exclusively for red corundum, and not
applied to other red minerals such as garnet,
spinel, etc., as is too often done.</p>

<p>It will be the purpose of this lesson to attempt
to set forth as clearly and as briefly as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
what constitutes good usage in the naming
of the principal stones, and also to point out
what incorrect usage is most in need of being
avoided.</p>

<p>To cover the subject systematically we
will adopt the order of hardness that we did
in discussing mineral species in <a href="#LESSON_XVIII">Lesson XVIII</a>.</p>

<p><b>Fancy Diamonds.</b> Beginning with the hardest
of all gems, the <i>diamond</i>, we have no difficulty
as regards naming, as all specimens of
this mineral, regardless of color, are called diamonds.
When it is necessary to designate
particular colors or tints, or differences in
tint, additional names are used&mdash;for example,
all diamonds of pronounced and pleasing
color are called "fancy" diamonds in
the trade. Certain of these "fancy" diamonds
are still further defined by using a
name specifying the color, as, for example,
"canary" diamonds (when of a fine bright
yellow), or "golden fancies," when of a fine
golden brown, or "orange," or "pink," or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
"absinthe green," or "violet," as the case
may be.</p>

<p><b>Names of Various Grades of White Diamonds.</b>
The great majority of the diamonds
which come on the market as cut stones belong,
however, to the group which would be spoken of
as white diamonds, but many qualifying names
are needed to express the degree of approach to
pure white possessed by different grades of these
diamonds. Thus the terms: 1, <i>J&auml;gers</i>; 2, <i>Rivers</i>;
3, <i>Blue Wesseltons</i>; 4, <i>Wesseltons</i>; 5, <i>Top Crystals</i>;
6, <i>Crystals</i>; 7, <i>very light brown</i>; 8, <i>Top
Silver Capes</i>; 9, <i>Silver Capes</i>; 10, <i>Capes</i>; 11,
<i>Yellows</i>, and 12, <i>Browns</i>, describe <i>increasing</i>
depth of color, and hence <i>decreasing</i> value in
diamonds.</p>

<p><b>Popular Names.</b> Certain more popular
names for diamonds of differing degrees of
whiteness may next be set forth. The term
"blue white" (a much abused expression, by
the way) should be applied only to diamonds
of such a close approach to pure whiteness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of body substance, as seen on edge in the paper
that, when faced up and undimmed, they give
such a strong play of <i>prismatic</i> blue that any
slight trace of yellow in their substance is
completely disguised, and the effect upon the
eye is notably blue. This would be the case
with stones of the grades from 1 through 4
in the list above. Grades 5 and 6 might
properly be called "<i>fine white</i>," and grades 7,
8, and 9 simply "<i>white</i>." Grade 10 is frequently
spoken of as "<i>commercial white</i>," and
grade 11 sometimes as "off color." Grade 12
includes all degrees of brownness except the very
light shades and the deep, pretty shades of
the "fancy" browns.</p>

<p><b>Rubies.</b> Leaving the naming of the different
colors of diamonds we come to the gems furnished
us by the mineral known as <i>corundum</i>.
As we have previously seen, this mineral occurs
in many different colors and with wide differences
of tint and shade in each of the principal colors.
The best practice with regard to naming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
corundum gems is to call the red material,
when of a good, full red of pleasing shade,
<i>ruby</i>. The finest shades of blood red are
usually called "<i>Burmah rubies</i>" because
more rubies of this quality are found in Burmah
than anywhere else. Any ruby of the
required shade would, however, be called a
Burmah ruby in the trade regardless of its
geographical origin. The most desirable tint
among Burmah rubies is that which is known as
"pigeon blood" in color. This color is perhaps
more accurately defined as like the color in the
center of the red of the solar spectrum. Certain
slightly deeper red rubies are said to be of
"beef blood" color. The English are said to
prefer these. Those of slightly lighter tint
than pigeon blood are sometimes referred to
as of "French color," from the fact that they
are preferred by French connoisseurs.</p>

<p>Rubies of dark, garnet-like shade are known
as "<i>Siam rubies</i>," many such being found in
that country. Light pinkish rubies are called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
"<i>Ceylon rubies</i>." It should be clearly kept
in mind that all these "rubies" are of red
corundum, and that in all their distinctive
properties except color they are essentially
similar.</p>

<p><b>Sapphires.</b> Corundum of fine blue color is
known as "<i>sapphire</i>." The "cornflower blue"
seems to be most in favor at present. Such sapphires
are sometimes called "<i>Kashmir sapphires</i>"
because many fine ones come from
that State. "<i>Ceylon sapphires</i>" are usually
paler than the cornflower blue. "<i>Montana
sapphires</i>" are usually of greenish blue or
pale electric blue. Such fine blue stones as
are mined in Montana would be sold under
another name according to the quality of
their color, and not as "Montana sapphires."
"<i>Australian sapphires</i>" are of a very deep,
inky blue, and do not command a high price.
Here again, as with rubies, the classification
depends upon the color rather than upon the
origin, although the geographical names that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
are used, correctly state the usual source of
stones of the particular color.</p>

<p>All corundums other than ruby and blue
sapphire are usually called by the term "sapphire,"
with a qualifying adjective designating
the color; thus we may have pink sapphire,
golden sapphire, green sapphire, etc. When
of very fine yellow color the yellow sapphire is
sometimes called "<i>Oriental topaz</i>" by jewelers,
the term "<i>Oriental</i>" as thus used indicating that
the material is corundum. We also have
"<i>Oriental amethyst</i>" and "<i>Oriental emerald</i>"
for the purple, and the fine green, and "<i>Oriental
aquamarine</i>" for the light blue-green corundum.
The yellow corundum is also sometimes called
"<i>King topaz</i>," especially in Ceylon. Inferior
sapphires of almost every conceivable color are
frequently assorted in lots and sold as "fancy
sapphires." Such lots, however, almost always
need reclassification as they often contain
as many as a dozen mineral species besides
corundum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Sapphires and rubies of minute tubular
internal structure frequently display a beautiful
six-pointed star when cut to a round-topped
cabochon shape and exposed to direct sunlight
or to light from any other single source. Such
stones are named "<i>star sapphire</i>" and "<i>star
ruby</i>."</p>

<p>The artificial rubies and sapphires should
all be called <i>scientific ruby</i> or <i>sapphire</i>, and
not "<i>reconstructed</i>" or "<i>synthetic</i>" as none
are made to-day from small, real rubies, and
as the process is in no sense a chemical synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Chrysoberyl.</b> Leaving the corundum gems
we come next to chrysoberyl. When the gems
furnished by this mineral are of a fine green
by daylight, and of a raspberry red by artificial
light, as is sometimes the case, they should
be called "<i>Alexandrites</i>" (after the Czar Alexander
II., in whose dominions, and on whose
birthday, the first specimens are said to have
been discovered). When chrysoberyl is of fibrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
or tubular internal structure it affords cat's-eyes
(when cabochon cut), and these should be specifically
named as "<i>chrysoberyl cat's-eye</i>" to
distinguish them from the less beautiful and
less valuable quartz cat's-eyes. Other varieties
of chrysoberyl (most of those marketed are of
a greenish-yellow color) are correctly named
simply "<i>chrysoberyls</i>." Such stones are, however,
sometimes incorrectly called "<i>chrysolite</i>"
by the trade, and this practice should be corrected,
as the term chrysolite applies correctly
only to the mineral <i>olivine</i> which gives us the
<i>peridot</i>.</p>

<p><b>Spinel.</b> Next in the order that we have
chosen comes "<i>spinel</i>." The more valuable
spinels are of a red color that somewhat closely
approaches the red of some rubies. Such
red spinels should be called "<i>Ruby spinel</i>"
(and <i>not spinel ruby</i>). The stones themselves
sometimes get mixed with corundum
rubies (they are frequently found in the same
gem gravels), and this makes it all the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
necessary that both stones and names should be
clearly distinguished. Some dealers call reddish
spinels "<i>Balas ruby</i>" (rose red), and orange red
ones "<i>rubicelle</i>." Violet red spinel is sometimes
called "<i>almandine spinel</i>." It is very desirable
that the name of the mineral species,
<i>spinel</i>, should be used, together with a qualifying
color adjective, in naming gems of this
species, rather than such terms as "rubicelle,"
"balas ruby," "spinel ruby," etc.</p>

<p><b>Topaz.</b> We come now to <i>topaz</i>. True, or
<i>precious topaz</i>, as it is usually called, to distinguish
it from the softer and less valuable
yellow quartz, is seldom seen in the trade to-day.
Jewelers almost always mean yellow quartz
when they speak of "topaz." This is an
unfortunate confusion of terms, and one which
will be hard to eradicate. There is seldom
any injustice done through this misnaming, as
the price charged is usually a fair one for the
material offered. Considerably higher prices
would be necessary if true topaz was in question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>An instance from the writer's experience
will serve to illustrate the confusion that
exists in the trade as to what should be
called topaz. A jeweler of more than ordinary
acquaintance with gems exhibited some fine
brooch stones as specimens of topaz. On
remarking that they were of course <i>citrine
quartz</i> rather than <i>true topaz</i>, the author was met
with the statement that the brooch stones
were <i>real</i> topaz. In order to make clear
to the dealer the difference between the two
species, the author asked him if he hadn't some
smaller topazes in stock that had cost him
considerably more than the brooch stones.
The dealer replied that he had some small
wine yellow topazes for which he had paid
more, and he produced them. The latter
stones were true Brazilian topazes. Most
of them had tiny, crackly flaws in them, as
is frequently the case, and, as the writer pointed
out to the dealer, they had been bought by the
<i>carat</i>, whereas the large brooch stones had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
bought at a certain price per <i>pennyweight</i>. In
fact the little stones had cost more per carat
than the larger ones had per pennyweight.</p>

<p>The dealer was then asked if there must
not be some difference in the real nature of
the two lots to justify paying more per carat
for small, imperfect stones than per pennyweight
for large perfect ones. He of course
acknowledged that it would appear reasonable
that such was the case. He was next
shown that his small <i>true topazes</i> scratched
his large stones easily, but the large ones
could get no hold upon the surfaces of the
small ones. (It will be remembered that topaz
has a hardness of 8, while quartz has a hardness
of 7.) The explanation then followed
that the two lots were from two entirely distinct
minerals, topaz and quartz, and that the former
was harder, took a somewhat better polish, and
was more rare (in fine colors) than quartz.
Of course the yellow quartz should be sold
under the proper name, <i>citrine quartz</i>. (From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the same root that we have in "<i>citrus</i>" as
applied to fruits. For example the "California
Citrus Fruit Growers' Association," which sells
oranges, lemons, grape fruit, etc. The color
implication is obvious.) If the jeweler still
wishes to use the term "topaz" because of the
familiarity of the public with that name, then
he should at least qualify it in some way. One
name that is current for that purpose is "Spanish
topaz," another is "Quartz-topaz." Perhaps
the latter is the least objectionable of the
names that include the word topaz.</p>

<p>Some of the wine yellow true topazes lose
the yellow, but retain the pink component,
on being gently heated. The resulting pink
stone is rather pretty and usually commands
a higher price than the yellow topazes. Such
artificially altered topazes should be sold only
for what they are, and probably the name
"pinked topaz," implying, as it does, that
something has been done to the stone, is as
good a name as any. There is, however, little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
chance of fraud in this connection, as natural
pink topazes are not seen in the trade, being very
rare.</p>

<p>Some bluish-green topaz is said to be sold as
aquamarine, and this confusion of species
and of names should, of course, be stopped by
an actual determination of the material as to its
properties. Lacking a refractometer, the widely
differing specific gravities of the two minerals
would easily serve to distinguish them.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<h2>LESSON XX</h2>

<h3>THE NAMING OF PRECIOUS STONES (<i>Concluded</i>)</h3>

<p><b>Beryl, Emerald, Aquamarine.</b> Coming now
to <i>beryl</i> we have first <i>emerald</i>, then <i>aquamarine</i>,
then beryls of other colors to consider. There
is too often a tendency among dealers to confuse
various green stones, and even doublets, under
the name <i>emerald</i>. While the price charged
usually bears a fair relation to the value of the
material furnished, it would be better to offer
tourmaline, or peridot (the mineral name of
which is olivine), or demantoid garnet (sometimes
wrongly called "Olivine"), or "emerald
doublets," or emerald or "imitation emerald,"
as the case might be, under their own names.</p>

<p>There are no true "synthetic" or "scientific"
or "reconstructed" emeralds, and none
of these terms should be used by the trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
There has been an effort made in some cases to
do business upon the good reputation of the
scientific rubies and sapphires, but the products
offered, when not out and out glass imitations,
have usually been doublets or triplets, consisting
partly of some pale, inexpensive, natural mineral,
such as quartz or beryl, and a layer of deep
green glass to give the whole a proper color.
All attempts to melt real emerald or beryl have
yielded only a <i>beryl glass</i>, softer and lighter
than true emerald, and not <i>crystalline</i>, but
rather glassy in structure. Hence the names
"reconstructed," "synthetic" and "scientific"
should never be applied to emerald.</p>

<p>The light green and blue green beryls are
correctly called <i>aquamarines</i>, the pale sky-blue
beryls should be named simply <i>blue beryl</i>.
Yellow beryl may be called <i>golden beryl</i>, or
it may be called "<i>heliodor</i>," a name that was
devised for the fine yellow beryl of Madagascar.
Beautiful pink beryl from Madagascar has
been called "<i>morganite</i>," a name that deserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to live in order to commemorate the great
interest taken by J. Pierpont Morgan in collecting
and conserving for future generations
many of the gems in the American Museum of
Natural History in New York.</p>

<p><b>Zircon.</b> We now come to a number of minerals
slightly less hard than beryl, but harder
than quartz, and <i>zircon</i> is perhaps as hard
as any of these, so it will be considered next.
Red zircon, which is rare, is properly called
"<i>hyacinth</i>." Many Hessonite garnets (cinnamon
stones) are incorrectly called hyacinths,
however. The true hyacinth has more snap
and fire owing to its adamantine surface luster
and high dispersive power, as well as to its high
refractive index. A true hyacinth is a beautiful
stone. Golden yellow zircons are correctly
called "<i>jacinths</i>." Artificially whitened zircons
(the color of which has been removed by heating)
are known as "jargoons" or sometimes
as "Matura diamonds." All other colors in
zircon should be named simply zircon, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a color adjective to indicate the particular
color as, "brown zircon," etc.</p>

<p><b>Tourmaline.</b> Tourmaline furnishes gems of
many different colors. These are all usually
called simply tourmaline, with a color adjective
to specify the particular color, as, for example,
the "pink tourmaline" of California.
Red tourmaline is, however, sometimes called
"<i>rubellite</i>," and white tourmaline has been
called "<i>achroite</i>." The latter material is seldom
cut, and hence the name is seldom seen or
used.</p>

<p><b>Garnet.</b> We may next consider the <i>garnets</i>,
as most of them are somewhat harder than
quartz. As was said in <a href="#LESSON_XVIII">Lesson XVIII.</a> in
our study of mineral species, there are several
types of garnets, characterized by similarity
of chemical composition, or at least
by analogy of composition, but, having specific
differences of property. The names used by
jewelers for the several types of garnets ought
to be a fairly true indication as to the type in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
hand in a particular case. At present there is
considerable confusion in the naming of garnets.
The most common practice is to call all garnets
of a purplish-red color "almandines." As many
such garnets belong to the mineral species
<i>almandite garnet</i>, there is little objection to
the continuance of this practice. The somewhat
less dense, and less hard blood red garnets
are properly called "<i>pyrope garnets</i>" (literally
"fire" garnets). Many of the Arizona garnets
belong in this division. The term "Arizona
<i>rubies</i>" should <i>not</i> be used. As was said under
ruby, nothing but red corundum should receive
that title. Similarly the pyrope garnet of the
diamond mines of South Africa is incorrectly
called "Cape ruby." Pyrope and almandite
garnet tend to merge in composition and in
properties, and the beautiful "<i>Rhodolite</i>" garnets
of Macon County, North Carolina, are between
the two varieties in composition, in
color, and in other properties.</p>

<p><i>Hessonite garnet</i> furnishes yellowish-red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
brownish-red stones, which are sometimes also
called "cinnamon stones." They are also
frequently and incorrectly called jacinth or
hyacinth, terms which, as we have seen, should
be reserved for yellow and red zircon, respectively.</p>

<p><i>Andradite garnet</i> furnishes brilliant green
stones, which have been incorrectly named
"Olivines" by the trade. The name is unfortunate
as it is identical with the true name
of the mineral which gives us peridot. The
name does not even suggest the color of these
garnets correctly, as they are seldom olive
green in shade. As the scarcity of fine specimens
and their great beauty make a fairly high
price necessary, the public would hardly pay it
for anything that was called "garnet," as garnets
are regarded as common and cheap. Perhaps
the adoption of the name "<i>Demantoid</i>"
might relieve the situation. The stones are frequently
referred to as "demantoid garnets"
on account of their diamond-like luster and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
dispersion. The use of "demantoid" alone,
if a noun may be made from the adjective, would
avoid both the confusion with the mineral
olivine, and the cheapening effect of the word
garnet, and would at the same time suggest
some of the most striking properties of the
material.</p>

<p>"<i>Spodumene</i>" furnishes pink to lilac "<i>Kunzite</i>,"
named after Dr. George F. Kunz, the gem
expert, and for a time an emerald green variety
was had from North Carolina which became
known as "<i>Hiddenite</i>," after its discoverer,
W. E. Hidden. No confusion of naming seems
to have arisen in regard to this mineral.</p>

<p>The next mineral in the scale of hardness
is quartz. (Hardness 7.) When pure and
colorless it should be called "<i>rock crystal</i>."
Purple quartz is of course <i>amethyst</i>. Some
dealers have adopted a bad practice of calling
the fine deep purple amethyst "Oriental"
amethyst, which should not be done, as the term
"Oriental" has for a long time signified a <i>corundum</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
gem. As Siberia has produced some very
fine amethysts, the term "<i>Siberian amethyst</i>"
would be a good one to designate any especially
fine gem.</p>

<p><b>Quartz Gems.</b> We have already considered
the naming of yellow quartz in connection with
topaz. "<i>Citrine quartz</i>" is probably the best
name for this material. If it is felt that the
name "topaz" must be used, the prefix "quartz"
should be used, or perhaps "Spanish topaz"
will do, but some effort should be made to
distinguish it from the true precious topaz. In
addition to amethyst and citrine quartz we
have the pinkish, milky quartz known as "<i>rose
quartz</i>." This is usually correctly named.</p>

<p>"<i>Cat's-eye</i>" is a term that should be reserved
for the Chrysoberyl variety, and the quartz
variety should always be called "quartz cat's-eye."
"<i>Tiger's-eye</i>" is a mineral in which
a soft fibrous material has been dissolved away,
and quartz has been deposited in its place.
"<i>Aventurine quartz</i>" is the correct name for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
quartz containing spangles of mica. Clear,
colorless pebbles of quartz are sometimes cut for
tourists. Such pebbles are frequently misnamed
"diamonds" with some prefix, as for example
"Lake George diamonds," etc. Among the
minutely crystalline varieties of quartz we
have the clear red, which should be called
"<i>carnelian</i>," the brownish-red "<i>sard</i>," the green
"<i>chrysoprase</i>," the leek green "<i>prase</i>," and the
brighter green "<i>plasma</i>." The last three are
not so commonly seen as the first two, and
frequently the best-colored specimens are artificially
dyed.</p>

<p>"<i>Jasper</i>," a material more highly regarded
by the ancients than at present, is mainly
quartz, but contains enough earthy material
to make it opaque. "<i>Bloodstone</i>" is a
greenish chalcedony with spots of red jasper.</p>

<p>"<i>Agates</i>" are banded chalcedonies, the variety
called "<i>onyx</i>" having very regular bands,
and the "<i>sardonyx</i>" being an onyx agate
in which some of the bands are of reddish sard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as we considered opal with quartz
(because of its chemical similarity) when
discussing mineral species, so we may now
consider the proper naming of opals here.
"<i>Precious opal</i>" is distinguished from "<i>common
opal</i>" by the beauty of its display rather
than by any difference in composition. The
effect is of course due to the existence of thin
films (probably of material of slightly different
density), filling what once were cracks in the
mass. The rainbow colors are the result of
interference of light (see a college text on physics
for an explanation of interference). The
varying thickness of these films gives varying
colors, so different specimens of opal show very
different effects. The differences of distribution
of the films within the material also cause
variations in the effects. Hence we have hardly
any two specimens of opal that are alike.</p>

<p>There are, however, certain fairly definite
types of opal and jewelers should learn to apply
correct names to these types. Most prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
among the opals of to-day are the so-called
"<i>Black opals</i>" from New South Wales. These
give vivid flashes of color out of seeming darkness.
In some positions the stones, as the name
implies, appear blue-black or blackish gray.
By transmitted light, however, the bluish stones
appear yellow. Owing to the sharp contrast
between the dark background and the flashing
spectrum colors, black opals are most attractive
stones and fine specimens command
high prices. One fine piece, which was on exhibition
at the Panama-Pacific Exposition was
in the shape of an elongated shield, about 1<span class="abv">3</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span>
inches by 1<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">8</span> inches in size and rather flat and
thin for its spread. It gave in one position a
solid surface of almost pure ruby red which
changed to green on tipping the stone to the
opposite direction; $2,000 was asked for the
piece.</p>

<p>"<i>White opal</i>" is the name applied to the
lighter shades of opal which do not show the
bluish-black effect in any position. "<i>Harlequin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
opal</i>" has rather large areas of definite colors
giving somewhat the effect of a map of the
United States in which the different States are
in different colors.</p>

<p>"<i>Fire opal</i>" is an orange-red variety. It
has some "play" of colors in addition to its
orange-red body color.</p>

<p>"<i>Opal Matrix</i>" has tiny specks and films
of precious opal distributed through a dark
volcanic rock and the mass is shaped and
polished as a whole.</p>

<p><b>Jade.</b> "<i>Jade</i>" should next receive attention.
It is a much abused term. Under it one may
purchase <i>jadeite</i>, <i>nephrite</i>, <i>bowenite</i>, <i>amazonite</i>,
or frequently simply <i>green glass</i>. The use of the
word ought to be confined to the first two minerals
mentioned, namely, jadeite and nephrite,
for they only possess the extreme toughness together
with considerable hardness that we expect
of jade. Bowenite, while tough, is relatively
soft and amazonite is brittle and also easily
cleavable, while glass is both soft and brittle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Peridot and Olivine.</b> The mineral "<i>olivine</i>"
gives us the "<i>peridot</i>" (this name should be kept
for the deeper bottle green stones), and the olive
green gems of this same mineral may correctly
be called "<i>olivine</i>" or "<i>chrysolite</i>."
As was explained under garnet, jewelers frequently
use the term "olivine" to designate
demantoid garnet. The term chrysolite is also
sometimes incorrectly used for the greenish-yellow
chrysoberyl.</p>

<p><b>Feldspar Gems.</b> Among the minerals softer
than quartz, which are used as gems, we have
also "<i>feldspar</i>," which gives us "<i>moonstone</i>,"
"<i>Labradorite</i>," and "<i>Amazonite</i>."</p>

<p>An opalescent form of chalcedony is frequently
gathered on California beaches and
polished for tourists under the name of "<i>California
Moonstone</i>." This name is unfortunately
chosen as the material is not the same as
that of true moonstone and the effect is not so
pronounced or so beautiful. The polished
stones show merely a milky cloudiness without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
any of that beautiful sheen of the true moonstone.
"<i>Labradorite</i>" is usually correctly
named. "<i>Amazonite</i>" was originally misnamed,
as none is found along the river of that
name. The term has come into such general
use, however, that we shall probably have to
continue to use it, especially as no other name
has come into use for this bluish-green feldspar.
As has already been said, amazonite is sometimes
sold as "jade," which is incorrect.</p>

<p><b>Malachite, Azurite, and Lapis Lazuli.</b> <i>Malachite</i>
and <i>azurite</i> are usually correctly
named, but "<i>lapis lazuli</i>" is a name that is
frequently misused, being applied to crackled
quartz that has been stained with Prussian
blue, or some other dye, to an unconvincing
resemblance to true lapis. Such artificially
produced stones are sometimes sold as "<i>Swiss
lapis</i>." They are harder than true lapis
and probably wear much better in exposed
ornaments, but they are not lapis and are never
of equal color, and names should not be misused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and especially is this true in a trade where the
public has had to rely so completely upon the
knowledge and the integrity of the dealer.</p>

<p>With the increase of knowledge about precious
stones that is slowly but steadily growing
among the public, it becomes more than ever
necessary for the jeweler and gem dealer to
know and to use the correct names for all precious
stones. The student who wishes to learn
more about the matter will have to cull his
information from many different works on gems.
G. F. Herbert-Smith, in his <i>Gem-Stones</i>, gives a
three and one half page chapter on "Nomenclature
of Precious Stones" (Chap. XIII.,
pp. 109-112). The present lesson has attempted
to bring together in one place material from
many sources, together with some suggestions
from the author.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXI</h2>

<h3>WHERE PRECIOUS STONES ARE FOUND</h3>

<p><b>Occurrence of Diamond.</b> Every dealer in
precious stones should know something of the
sources of the gems that he sells. The manner
of the occurrence of the rough material is also a
matter of interest. It will therefore be the
purpose of this lesson to give a brief account of
the geographical sources of the principal gems
and of their mode of occurrence in the earth.</p>

<p>For the sake of uniformity of treatment
we will once more follow the descending order
of hardness among the gems and we thus
begin by describing the occurrence of diamond.
It will be of interest to note first that the earliest
source of the diamond was India, and that for
many years India was almost the sole source.
Tavernier tells us that the diamond mining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
industry was in a thriving state during the
years from 1640 to 1680, during which time he
made six journeys to India to purchase gems.
He speaks of Borneo as another source of
diamonds, but most of the diamonds of that
time were furnished by India.</p>

<p><b>"Golcondas."</b> Indian diamonds were noteworthy
for their magnificent steely blue-white
quality and their great hardness, and occasionally
one comes on the market to-day with an
authentic pedigree, tracing its origin back
to the old Indian mines, and such stones
usually command very high prices. One of
a little over seven and one half carats in weight,
in the form of a perfect drop brilliant, has
lately been offered for sale at a price not far
from $1,000 per carat. Such diamonds are
sometimes called "Golcondas" because one of
the mining districts from which the fine large
Indian stones came was near the place of that
name. Some of the stones from the J&auml;gersfontein
mine in South Africa resemble the Golcondas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in quality. Many of the large historical crown
diamonds of Europe came from the Indian mines.</p>

<p>The stones were found in a sedimentary
material, a sort of conglomerate, in which
they, together with many other crystalline
materials, had become imprisoned. Their original
source has never been determined. They
are therefore of the so-called "River" type
of stone, having probably been transported
from their original matrix, after the disintegration
of the latter, to new places of deposit, by
the carrying power of river waters.</p>

<p>The Indian mines now yield very few stones.
The United States Consular reports occasionally
mention the finding of a few scattered crystals
but the rich deposits were apparently worked
out during the seventeenth century and the
early part of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In 1725 and in the few following years the
Brazilian diamond fields began to supersede
those of India. Like the latter, the Brazilian
fields were alluvial, that is, the materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
were deposited by river action after having
been carried to some distance from their original
sources.</p>

<p><b>Brazilian Diamonds.</b> The diamonds of Brazil
also resembled those of India in quality, being
on the average better than those of the present
South African mines. It may be added that
even the African diamonds that are found in
"river diggings" average better in quality than
those of the volcanic pipes which form the
principal source of the world's supply to-day.
There seems to be a superabundance of iron
oxide in the rocks of the African mines and in
the diamonds themselves, imparting yellow or
brownish tints to the material. The "River"
stones seem to have lost this color to a considerable
extent, if they ever had it. Possibly
long extraction with water has removed the very
slightly soluble coloring material. Whatever
the cause of their superiority "River" stones
have always been more highly regarded than
stones from the volcanic pipes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Brazil furnished the world's principal supply
of diamonds until the discovery of the African
stones in 1867. At present relatively small
numbers of Brazilian stones reach the world's
markets. Most of these come from the great
Bahia district (discovered in 1844) rather than
from the older mines of Brazil. The present
Brazilian stones average of small size. They are,
however, of very good quality as a rule. A few
green stones are found in Brazil and these may be
of an absinthe-green or of a pistachio-green tint.</p>

<p><b>Australian and American Sources.</b> While a
few diamonds now come on the market from
New South Wales, and while an occasional stone
is found in the United States (usually in glacial
drift in the north central States, or in volcanic
material somewhat resembling that of South
Africa in Arkansas) yet the world's output now
comes almost entirely from South Africa and
mainly from the enormous volcanic pipes of
the Kimberly district and those of the Premier
Co. in the Transvaal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p><b>South African Diamonds.</b> The nature of the
occurrence of diamond in the "pipes" of South
Africa is so well known to all who deal in diamonds
to-day that but little space need be devoted
to it. The "blue ground," as the rock in
which the diamonds are found is called, seems
to have been forced up from below, perhaps
as the material of a mud volcano, bringing
with it the diamonds, garnets, zircons, and
the fifty or more other minerals that have
been found in the blue ground. The fragmentary
character of some of these minerals
would indicate that the blue ground was not
their original matrix. How the diamonds
originally crystallized and where, is still probably
a matter for further speculation.</p>

<p>While at first the mines were worked, like
quarries, from the surface, and while the great
Premier mine is still so worked, most of the
present mines are worked by sinking shafts
in the native rock outside of the blue ground
and then tunneling into the diamond-bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
rock laterally, removing it to the surface, allowing
it to weather on the "floors" until it
crumbles, then crushing and washing it and
concentrating the heavy minerals by gravity
methods. Large diamonds are then picked out
of the concentrates by hand and small ones
and fragments are removed by the "greasers,"
which are shaking tables heavily smeared
with grease over which the concentrates are
washed and to which diamond alone, of all the
minerals in the concentrate, sticks. The grease
is periodically removed and melted, and the
diamonds secured. The grease can then be
used again.</p>

<p>German South West Africa furnishes a
considerable output of very small diamonds,
which are found in dry sand far from any
present rivers. These diamonds cut to splendid
white melee and the output is large enough to
make some difference in the relative price of
small stones as compared to large ones. The
South West African field seldom yields a stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that will afford a finished quarter-carat diamond.</p>

<p><b>Rubies.</b> Passing on to the occurrence of the
<i>corundum</i> gems we will consider first the <i>ruby</i>.
Most fine rubies come from Burmah. The
district in which they are found is near Mogok.
Practically all the fine pigeon-blood rubies come
from this district. The fashion for red stones
being for the time little in evidence rubies are not
now in great demand. This cessation of demand
can hardly be laid to the competition of the
scientific ruby, for the sapphire is now very
much in vogue, yet scientific sapphires resemble
the natural ones even more closely
than do the rubies.</p>

<p>Siam furnishes a considerable number of
dark garnet-like rubies. These do not command
high prices. They are, however, sometimes
very beautiful, especially when well cut
for brilliancy, and when in a strong light.</p>

<p>Ceylon furnishes a few rubies and a few red
corundums have been found in North Carolina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>The Burmese rubies appear to have been
formed in a limestone matrix, but most of
those obtained are gotten from the stream
beds, where they have been carried by water
after weathering out from the mother rock.</p>

<p>The rubies of Ceylon, too, probably originated
in a limestone matrix, but are sought in
stream gravels.</p>

<p><b>Sapphires.</b> Fine blue sapphires originate in
Siam in larger numbers than in any other locality.
Kashmir, in India, also supplies splendid
specimens of large size. Ceylon, too,
furnishes a good deal of sapphire, but mostly
of a lighter color than the Kashmir sapphire.
The Ceylon sapphires are found in the streams,
but originate in rock of igneous origin.</p>

<p>Montana furnishes considerable quantities
of sapphire, some of which is of very good color.
It is, of course, as good as the Oriental if of equal
color, being of the same material. The better
colored sapphire from Montana is mined from
the rock. Most of the sapphires found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
river gravels near Helena, Mont., are greenish blue
or of other colors, and not of fine blue.</p>

<p>Queensland and Victoria in Australia supply
considerable quantities of sapphire. When
blue the Australian sapphire is usually too dark
to be very valuable. The golden and other
"fancy" sapphires of the trade come largely
from the Ceylon gravels. Siam yields silky
brown stones and some fine green ones. Some
of the Australian sapphires when cut in certain
directions yield green stones.</p>

<p><b>Chrysoberyl.</b> Chrysoberyl of the variety
Alexandrite now comes mainly from Ceylon,
although formerly from the Ural Mountains.</p>

<p>The cat's-eyes also come chiefly from Ceylon.</p>

<p>The yellowish-green chrysoberyls (which
jewelers sometimes call chrysolite) come both
from Ceylon and from Brazil. They are frequently
found in papers of "fancy sapphires"
or "fancy color stones," so called.</p>

<p><b>Spinel.</b> Spinels are found along with ruby in
Burmah and in Siam and they also occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in the gem gravels of Ceylon. Limestone is
the usual matrix of spinel, although it is more
often mined in gravels resulting from the
weathering of the matrix.</p>

<p><b>Topaz.</b> True topaz, of wine-yellow color,
comes mostly from Brazil. Ceylon also furnishes
yellow topaz. Asiatic Russia furnishes
fine large blue or blue-green crystals resembling
aquamarine in appearance. Most of the topaz
found in other localities is pale or colorless.
Several of our western States, notably Utah,
Colorado, and California, furnish colorless topaz.
Mexico and Japan also produce it. It is seldom
cut, for, while producing a rather brilliant stone,
it has little "fire" and is therefore not very
attractive.</p>

<p><b>Emerald and Aquamarine.</b> Beryl of the
emerald variety is exceedingly scarce in the
earth. Most of the best emerald comes from
Colombia, South America. Large crystals of
paler color come from the Urals.</p>

<p>Like ruby and spinel, emerald usually originates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
in limestone. One is tempted to suspect
that these stones are of aqueous origin and that
sapphires, and beryl, other than emerald, are
more likely of igneous origin.</p>

<p>Beryls of the aquamarine type occur in
many places, but usually of too pale a tint,
or too imperfect, to be worthy of cutting.
Fine gem beryl of blue and blue-green tints
comes from Siberia and from several places in
the Ural Mountains on their Asiatic slopes.</p>

<p>The Minas Geraes district of Brazil, famous
for all kinds of gem stones, furnishes most of
the aquamarine of commerce. The pegmatite
dikes of Haddam Neck, Conn., of Stoneham,
Me., and of San Diego County, Cal., have furnished
splendid aquamarine and other beryl.
These dikes, according to the geological evidence,
are the result of the combined action of
heat and water. Thus both melting and dissolving
went on together and as a result many fine
gem minerals of magnificent crystallization were
formed during the subsequent cooling. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
longer the cooling lasted and the more free
space for growth the crystals had, the larger
and more perfect they got. The author has
himself obtained finely crystallized aquamarine
and tourmaline from the Haddam, Conn.,
locality and the best specimens there occur
in "pockets" or cavities in the coarse granite.
Within, these pockets are lined with crystals
of smoky quartz, tourmaline, beryl, and other
minerals. Sometimes crystals occur in mud or
clay masses inside the cavities and such crystals,
having been free to grow uninterruptedly
in every direction, were perfect in form, being
doubly terminated, and not attached anywhere
to the rock.</p>

<p>Madagascar has in recent years furnished
the finest pink beryl, which has been named
Morganite. Yellow beryl (Heliodor) and aquamarine
also occur in Madagascar.</p>

<p><b>Zircon.</b> Zircon comes on the market mainly
from Ceylon. It deserves to be as much
esteemed in this country as it is in Ceylon, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
its optical properties are such that it is a very
snappy stone. Some of the colors in which
it occurs, such as the golden browns, lend
themselves nicely to the matching of gems
and garments, and, with the growth of education
in such matters, jewelers would do well
to get better acquainted with the possibilities
of zircon and to introduce it to their customers.
The supply from Ceylon is sufficient to justify
popularizing the stone. Small zircons are found
in almost every heavy concentrate, as, for example,
in the concentrates of the diamond mines
of South Africa, and in those of gold placers
in many places. The rough stones resemble
rough diamonds in luster and are sometimes
mistaken for diamonds.</p>

<p><b>Garnets.</b> Garnets of various types are found
widely distributed in nature. Perhaps the Bohemian
supply is best known, having furnished a
host of small stones which have usually been
rose cut for cluster work or made into beads.
The Bohemian garnets are of the pyrope or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
fire-red type. Relatively few large stones of
sufficient transparency for cutting are produced
in the Bohemian mines. The so-called "Cape
rubies" of the diamond mines of South Africa
are pyrope garnets and some large and fine
ones are found. The "Arizona rubies" are
pyrope garnets, and while seldom of notable
size, some are of very fine color, approaching
deep rubies, and the color remains attractive
by artificial light.</p>

<p>Almandite garnet, the "almandine" of the
jeweler is less abundant than pyrope, when
of gem quality. Ceylon furnishes some and
India furnishes perhaps more. Brazil, from
its prolific gem gravels at Minas Novas, supplies
good almandite, and smaller quantities are
found in many different localities.</p>

<p>Hessonite garnet, the cinnamon stone or
"hyacinth" (incorrect) of the trade, comes
mainly from Ceylon.</p>

<p>Andradite garnet, of the variety known as
demantoid, from its diamond-like properties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and which is usually sold under the misleading
name "olivine" in the trade, comes from
the western slopes of the Ural Mountains.</p>

<p><b>Tourmaline.</b> Gem tourmaline comes from
Ceylon, from Madagascar, from the Ural
Mountains, from Brazil, from Maine, from
Connecticut, and from California.</p>

<p>The Ceylon tourmalines are mostly yellow
or yellowish green, sometimes fine olive-green.
Those from the Urals may be
pink, blue or green. Brazilian tourmalines
are usually green, but sometimes red. In
fact in many localities several colors of tourmaline
are usually found together and it may
be that a single crystal will be green in most of
its length but red or pink tipped. Some
crystals have a pink core and a green exterior.
The author has found both of the two latter
types in the Haddam, Conn., tourmalines, and
on one occasion was surprised to get back a
wine-colored tourmaline from a cutter to whom
he had sent a green crystal. There was but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
a thin shell of the green material on the outside
of the crystal.</p>

<p>Some of the Madagascar tourmaline is of
a fine brownish red, almost as deep as a
light garnet, and much clearer than most
garnet.</p>

<p>Would it not be fitting on account of its
occurrence in several localities in the United
States, for Americans to use more tourmaline
in their jewels? The quality of some of the
tourmalines of Maine, and of California especially,
is not excelled by tourmaline from any
other locality. Some of the Maine tourmaline
is of a delightful, slightly bluish-green tint that
almost approaches emerald.</p>

<p><b>Kunzite.</b> Spodumene, of the variety kunzite,
comes from San Diego County, California.</p>

<p><b>Quartz Gems.</b> Coming now to the quartz
gems we find amethyst and citrine, or golden
quartz widely distributed so that only the localities
that furnish the better grades of these
stones need be mentioned. Siberia and Uruguay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
furnish fine amethyst. Brazil also furnishes
large quantities of very good quality.</p>

<p><b>Amethyst.</b> The chief charm of the Siberian
amethyst lies in its large red component,
which enables it to change from a deep grape-purple
by daylight to a fine red by artificial
light that is rich in red rays, and poor in blue
ones. The paler types of amethysts that were
once esteemed, probably for lack of the rich deep
variety, become gray in appearance and much
less lovely under artificial light. India furnishes
some amethysts, and papers of "fancy color
stones" containing native cut gems from Ceylon,
frequently contain amethysts, but Brazil, Uruguay,
and Siberia furnish the great bulk of the
stones that are regarded as choice to-day.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Quartz.</b> Citrine or golden quartz
comes mainly from Brazil. The "Spanish
topaz" is sometimes the result of heating
smoky quartz from Cordova province in Spain.
Our own western mountains furnish considerable
yellow and smoky quartz fit for cutting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Rose Quartz.</b> Rose quartz of the finest
quality comes from South Dakota. Bavaria,
the Ural Mountains, and Paris, Maine, have also
furnished it.</p>

<p><b>Agate.</b> Agates of the finest types, such as
carnelian and sard, come principally from
Brazil and from India.</p>

<p><b>Opal.</b> Opals now come most largely from
Australia, the Hungarian mines yielding but
few stones at present. The fine black opals
of New South Wales are unsurpassed by
any that have ever been found elsewhere.
Mexico furnishes considerable opal, and is
notable for its fine "fire opal" or "cherry opal."</p>

<p><b>Jade.</b> Most of the jade of the variety nephrite
that is obtained to-day comes from
several of the provinces of China or from Siberia
or from Turkestan. A dark-green nephrite
comes from New Zealand.</p>

<p>Jade of the jadeite variety, which is harder
than nephrite and more highly valued, is
rare. The best specimens come from Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Burmah. It is also found in China and in
Tibet.</p>

<p><b>Peridot.</b> Peridot, and the brighter olivine or
chrysolite, while of the same mineral species,
do not seem to occur together. The darker
bottle-green specimens come from the Island of
St. John in the Red Sea. It is said that many
of the finer peridots now available have been
recut from old stones mined many years ago.</p>

<p>Queensland supplies light-green chrysolite,
and Arizona a yellowish-green variety. Light-green
stones have been found near the ruby
mines of Upper Burmah.</p>

<p><b>Moonstone.</b> Moonstone comes mainly from
Ceylon. The native cut specimens are sent
here and recut, as, when native cut, the direction
of the grain is seldom correct to produce
the moonlight effect in symmetrical fashion.
The native cutters apparently try to retain
all the size and weight that is possible, regardless
of the effect.</p>

<p><b>Turquoise.</b> Turquoise of the finest blue and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
most compact texture (and hence least subject
to color change) comes from the province
of Khorasan in Persia. Several of our western
states supply turquoise of fair quality, notably
New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California.</p>

<p><b>Lapis Lazuli.</b> Lapis Lazuli comes from Afghanistan,
from Siberia, and from South
America.</p>

<p><b>Malachite.</b> Malachite is found in many
copper mines, but principally in those of the
Ural Mountains.</p>

<p><b>Azurite.</b> Azurite is found in the Arizona
mines and in Chessy, in France (hence the name
chessylite, sometimes used instead of azurite).</p>

<h3>HOW ROUGH PRECIOUS STONES ARE CUT</h3>

<p><b>Rough Precious Stones.</b> John Ruskin, who
had the means to acquire some very fine natural
specimens of gem material was of the opinion
that man ought not to tamper with the wonderful
crystals of nature, but that rather they
should be admired in the rough. While one
can understand Ruskin's viewpoint, nevertheless
the art of man can make use of the optical
properties of transparent minerals, properties
no less wonderful than those exhibited in crystallization,
and indeed intimately associated
with the latter, and, by shaping the rough material
in accordance with these optical properties,
greatly enhance the beauty of the gem.</p>

<p>No material illustrates the wonderful improvement
that may be brought about by cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and polishing better than diamond. In the
rough the diamond is less attractive in appearance
than rock crystal. G. F. Herbert-Smith
likens its appearance to that of soda crystals.
Another author likens it to gum arabic. The
surface of the rough diamond is usually ridged by
the overlapping of minute layers or strata of the
material so that one cannot look into the clear
interior any more than one can look into a bank,
through the prism-glass windows that are so
much used to diffuse the light that enters by
means of them. Being thus of a rough exterior
the uncut diamond shows none of the snap and
fire which are developed by proper cutting.</p>

<p>As the diamond perhaps shows more improvement
on being cut than any other stone, and as
the art of cutting the diamond is distinct from
that of cutting other precious stones, both in the
method of cutting and in the fact that the
workers who cut diamonds cut no other precious
stones, it will be well to consider diamond
cutting separately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Before discussing the methods by which
the shaping and polishing are accomplished
let us consider briefly the object that is in
view in thus altering the shape and smoothing
the surface of the rough material.</p>

<p><b>How Cutting Increases Brilliancy.</b> Primarily
the object of cutting a diamond is to make
it more brilliant. So true is this that the
usual form to which diamonds are cut has come
to be called the <i>brilliant</i>. The adjective has
become a noun. The increased brilliancy is due
mainly to two effects: First, greatly increased
reflection of light, and second, dispersion of
light. The reflection is partly external but
principally internal.</p>

<p>Taking up first the internal reflection which is
responsible for most of the white brilliancy of the
cut stone we must note that it is a fact that light
that is passing through any transparent material
will, upon arriving at any polished surface,
either penetrate and emerge or else it will be
reflected within the material, depending upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the angle at which the light strikes the surface.
For each material there is a definite angle outside
of which light that is passing as above
described, is <i>totally reflected</i> within the material.</p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 317px;"><a name="fig9" id="fig9"></a>
<img src="images/011.png" width="317" height="189" alt="" title="" />

<div class="bk1"><p><i>AB</i> represents the back surface of a piece of
diamond.</p>

<p><i>CD</i> is a line perpendicular to <i>AB</i>.</p>

<p>Angle <i>CDE</i> is about 24 degrees.</p>

<p>Dotted line, <i>FDH</i> represents the course taken
by a ray of light which is totally reflected at <i>D</i>
in such fashion that angle <i>FDA</i> equals angle
<i>HDB</i>.</p>

<p>Any light proceeding towards <i>AB</i> but between
<i>E</i> and <i>C</i>, would fail to be totally reflected. Most
of it would penetrate <i>AB</i>.</p></div>

<p><b>Total Reflection.</b> For diamond this <i>critical
angle</i>, as it is called, is very nearly 24&deg; from a
perpendicular to the surface. If now, we shape
a diamond so that most of the light that enters
it from the front falls upon the first back surface
that it meets, at an angle greater than 24&deg;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to a perpendicular to that surface, the light will
be totally reflected within the stone. The angle
at which it is reflected will be the same as that
at which it meets the surface. In other
words the angles of incidence and of reflection
are equal. See <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a> for an illustration of this
point.</p>

<p><b>Theory of the "Brilliant."</b> In the usual
"brilliant" much of the light that enters
through the front surface is thus totally reflected
from the first rear facet that it meets and
then proceeds across the stone to be again
totally reflected from the opposite side of
the brilliant. This time the light proceeds
toward the top of the stone. See <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>&mdash;(From
G. F. Herbert-Smith's <i>Gem-Stones</i>).</p>

<p>The angles of the top of a brilliant are
purposely made so flat that the up coming
light fails to be totally reflected again and
is allowed to emerge to dazzle the beholder.
In the better made brilliants the angle that the
back slope makes with the plane of the girdle is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
very nearly 41&deg; and the top angle, or angle of
the front slope to the plane of the girdle is about
35&deg;. Such well made brilliants when held up to
a bright light appear almost black&mdash;that is,
they fail to pass any of the light through them
(except through the tiny culet, which, being
parallel to the table above, passes light that
comes straight down to it).</p>

<img src="images/012.png" width="319" height="228" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig. 10.&mdash;Course of the Rays of Light
Passing Through a Brilliant.</span></div>

<p>In other words, instead of allowing the
light to penetrate them, well-made brilliants
almost totally reflect it back toward its source,
that is, toward the front of the stone. The well-cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
diamond is a very brilliant object, viewed
from the front.</p>

<p>We must now consider how the "fire"
or prismatic color play is produced, for it
is even more upon the display of fire than
upon its pure white brilliancy that the beauty
of a diamond depends.</p>

<p><b>Cause of "Fire."</b> As we saw in <a href="#LESSON_X">Lesson X.</a>
(which it would be well to re-read at this time),
white light that changes its course from one
transparent medium to another at any but a
right angle to the surface involved, is not only
refracted (as we saw in <a href="#LESSON_II">Lesson II.</a>) but is dispersed,
that is, light of different colors is bent
by differing amounts and thus we have a separation
of the various colors. If this takes place
as the ray of light leaves the upper surface of a
brilliant the observer upon whose eye the light
falls will see either the red, or the yellow, or the
blue, as the case may be, rather than the white
light which entered the stone. If instead, the
dispersion takes place as the light enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the brilliant the various colored rays thus
produced will be totally reflected back to
the observer (slightly weakened by spreading,
as compared to the direct or unreflected
spectra). Thus dispersion produces the "fire"
in a brilliant.</p>

<p>Other materials than diamond behave similarly,
but usually to a much smaller extent,
for few gem materials have so high a refractive
power or so great a dispersive power as diamond.</p>

<p>Having considered the theory of the brilliant
we may now take up a study of the methods
by which the exceedingly hard rough diamond
is shaped and polished.</p>

<p><b>Cleaving Diamonds.</b> If the rough material
is of poor shape, or if it has conspicuous defects
in it which prevent its being made into a single
stone, it is cleaved (<i>i. e.</i>, split along its grain).
Hard as it is, diamond splits readily in certain
definite directions (parallel to any of the triangular
faces of the octahedral crystal). The
cleaver has to know the grain of rough diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
from the external appearance, even when the
crystals, as found, are complicated modifications
of the simple crystal form. He can
thus take advantage of the cleavage to speedily
reduce the rough material in size and shape
to suit the necessity of the case. The cleaving
is accomplished by making a nick or groove in
the surface of the rough material at the proper
point (the stone being held by a tenacious wax,
in the end of a holder, placed upright in a firm
support). A thin steel knife blade is then
inserted in the nick and a sharp light blow
struck upon the back of the knife blade. The
diamond then readily splits.</p>

<p><b>"Cutting Diamonds."</b> The next step is to
give the rough material a shape closely similar
to that of the finished brilliant but rough and
without facets. This shaping or "cutting" as
it is technically called, is done by placing the
rough stone in the end of a holder by means
of a tough cement and then rotating holder
and stone in a lathe-like machine. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
rough diamond (sometimes a piece of bort,
unfit for cutting, and sometimes a piece of
material of good quality which it is necessary
to reduce in size or alter in shape) is cemented
into another holder and held against the surface
of the rotating diamond. The holder is steadied
against a firm support. It now becomes a case
of "diamond cut diamond," each stone wearing
away the other and being worn away itself.</p>

<p>The cutting process is fairly rapid and it
leaves the stone (which is reversed to make
the opposite side) round in form and with a
rounding top and cone-shaped back. Stones
of fancy shape, such as square, or cushion shape,
have to be formed in part by hand rubbing or
"bruting" as it is called.</p>

<p>The facets must now be polished onto the
stone. Usually the workers who cut do not
cleave or polish.</p>

<p><b>"Polishing" Diamonds.</b> The polisher fixes
the cut stone firmly in a metallic holder called a
dop, which is cleverly designed to hold the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
with much of one side of it exposed. The
holder is then inverted so that the stone is
beneath and a stout copper wire attached
to the holder is then clamped firmly in a sort of
movable vise. The latter is then placed on
the bench in such a position that the diamond
rests upon the surface of a rapidly revolving
horizontal iron wheel or "lap" as it is called.
The surface of the latter is "charged" with
diamond dust, that is, diamond dust has been
pushed into the metal surface which thus acts as
a support to the dust. The latter wears away
the diamond, producing a flat facet. The
lap is kept moistened with oil and from time to
time fresh oil and diamond dust are applied.
A speed of about 2,000 rotations per minute
is used.</p>

<p><b>Facetting.</b> The making of the facets is rather
slow work, especially when, as is usually the
case in making the "table" the work has to
be done against one of the "hard points"
of the crystal. Great care has to be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to place the stone so that the grain lies in
a correct position, for diamond cannot be
polished against the grain, nor even exactly
with it, but only obliquely across it. This requirement,
as much as anything, has prevented
the use of machines in polishing diamonds.
The table is usually first polished on, then the
four top slopes, dividing the top surface into
quarters, then each of the four ridges thus
left, is flattened, making eight facets and
finally 32 facets, exclusive of the table, are made
upon the top of the brilliant. The stone is then
reversed and 24 facets, and the culet, polished
on the back. As each facet nears its
proper shape the stone is placed upon a particularly
smooth part of the lap and a slight
vibratory motion given to the holder by the
hand. This smooths out any lines or grooves
that may have formed because of inequalities of
surface of the lap. When completely facetted
the brilliant is finished and requires only to be
cleaned, when it is ready for sale.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXIII</h2>

<h3>HOW ROUGH PRECIOUS STONES ARE CUT AND
WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD "MAKE"&mdash;<i>Concluded</i></h3>

<p><b>Slitting and Cleaving.</b> The cutting and
polishing of precious stones other than diamond
is a trade entirely distinct from diamond cutting.
The precious stone lapidary cuts every species
of stone except diamond. The methods used by
different lapidaries vary somewhat in their
details, and there are many trade secrets which
are more or less jealously guarded by their
possessors, but in general the methods used to
reduce the rough materials to the finished gems
are as follows: First, the rough material, if of
too large size, or if very imperfect, is <i>slitted</i>, or,
if it possesses a pronounced cleavage, it may be
<i>cleaved</i>, in order to reduce the size or to remove
imperfect parts. <i>Slitting</i> is accomplished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
means of a circular disc of thin metal which is
hammered so that it will be flat and rotate
truly, and is then clamped between face plates,
much as an emery wheel is held. The smooth
edge of the circular disc is then charged with
diamond dust and oil, the diamond dust being
bedded into the edge of the metal disc by the
pressure of some hard, fine-grained material,
such as chalcedony, or rolled into the metal by
the use of a rotating roller. Once charged, and
kept freely supplied with oil, a slitting wheel will
slice a considerable number of pieces of any
precious stone less hard than diamond, and will
do so with considerable rapidity. The wheel
is, of course, rotated very rapidly for this purpose.</p>

<p>The cleaving of certain gem materials,
such as true topaz (which splits perfectly
across the prism, parallel to its base) is easily
accomplished, and it is done in much the same
manner as the cleaving of diamond. The feldspar
gems, such as moonstone, amazonite, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
labradorite, also cleave very smoothly in certain
directions. Spodumene, of which Kunzite is a
variety, cleaves almost too easily to be durable.
Most gem minerals, however, lack such perfect
cleavage and when it is desired to remove imperfect
parts, or to reduce large pieces to
smaller sizes, these materials are slitted as above
described.</p>

<p><b>"Rubbing Down."</b> The material being of
nearly the dimensions of the finished piece, the
next step is to "rub it down," as it is called, to
approximately the shape and size desired. This
rubbing down process was formerly done by
means of a soft metal lap (sometimes of lead),
charged with coarse emery powder and water.
Carborundum, being harder and sharper than
emery, has replaced it very largely. Some of the
softer materials, such, for example, as turquoise,
are rubbed down on a fast flying carborundum
wheel of similar type to those used in
machine shops for grinding steel tools. These
wheels rotate in a vertical plane and are kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
wet. The laps before mentioned run horizontally.
The carborundum wheels have the
grains of carborundum cemented together by
means of some binding material and this gradually
crumbles, exposing fresh, sharp cutting
edges. Various sizes of grain, and various
degrees of hardness of the binding material, as
well as various speeds, are needed to suit the
many different materials rubbed down by the
lapidary. Some lapidaries rub down the harder
and more valuable gems such as ruby upon
diamond charged laps of brass or other metal.</p>

<p><b>Cabochons.</b> The rubbing down process does
not leave a facetted surface, but only a coarse
roughly rounded or flattened surface. If the
material is to be left in some one of the flat-backed,
rounded top forms known as cabochon
cut, the surfaces need only to be smoothed (by
means of very fine abrasives such as fine emery
applied by means of laps, or even by fine emery
or carborundum cloth), and they are then
ready for polishing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Facetted Stones.</b> If, however, the stone
is to be facetted in either the brilliant form,
somewhat like the diamond, or step cut or
otherwise facetted, it is cemented strongly
onto a holder (much like the wooden part
of a pen holder). The upper end of the holder
is rested in one of a series of holes in what is
called a "<i>ginpeg</i>" resting in the work-bench
near a metal lap, and the stone is pressed upon
the rapidly rotating surface of the lap, which is
charged with diamond dust or carborundum,
according to the hardness of the material to be
facetted. A flat facet is thus ground upon the
stone. By rotating the holder a series of facets,
all in the same set, is produced. The holder is
then changed to a new position on the ginpeg and
another set of facets laid upon the stone. Thus
as many as four or five tiers or sets of facets may
be applied to one side, say the top of the stone.
The latter is then removed from the holder and
cemented to it again, this time with the bottom
exposed, and several sets of facets applied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The stone is now <i>cut</i> but not <i>polished</i>. The
facets are flat, but have a rough ground-glass
like surface. The polishing is usually done by
workers who do not cut stones, but who do
nothing but polish them. In small shops, however,
the same lapidary performs all the parts
of the work.</p>

<p><b>Polishing.</b> The polishing of stones, whether
cabochon or facetted, is accomplished by the
use of very finely powdered abrasives such
as corundum powder, tripoli, pumice, putty
powder, etc. Each gem material requires
special treatment to obtain the best results.
It is here that most of the trade secrets apply.</p>

<p>The troubles of the lapidary in getting the
keen polish that is so much admired on fine
gems are many. In general, the polishing powder
should not be quite as hard as the material
to be polished, else it may grind rather than
polish. The material should be used with water
or oil to give it a creamy consistency. It should
be backed by laps of different materials for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
different purposes. Thus, when backed by a
fairly hard metal even tripoli, although much
softer, will polish sapphire. On a lap of wood,
tripoli would fail to polish hard materials, but
would polish amethyst or other quartz gem. A
change of speed of the lap, too, changes the
effect of the polishing material. I have seen a
lapidary, who was having no success at polishing
an emerald, get very good results by using
a stick as a brake and slowing down his lap.</p>

<p>The polishing material must be of very
uniform size, preferably water floated or oil
floated, to give good results. The lap must be
kept flat and true and the stone must be properly
held, or the flatness of the facets, upon which
brilliancy depends in part, will be destroyed
during the polishing.</p>

<p>The softer materials, such as opal, require
treatment more like that accorded cut glass,
and soft abrasive powders, such as pumice,
suffice to polish them. Probably hardly two
lapidaries would work exactly alike in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
treatment of precious stones, and each guards
his secrets, yet all use approximately similar
general methods. Some have devised mechanical
holders which permit the repeated cutting of
stones to exactly the same angles, and that, too,
with an accurate knowledge of the angles
used. These angles can be definitely altered
for different materials, according to their
refractive indices. Other lapidaries produce
very fine results by purely hand methods.</p>

<p>These details have been gone into to give
an idea of the methods of the lapidary and of
the many variations in method. In general,
however, the <i>slitting</i> or <i>cleaving</i>, the <i>rubbing
down</i> to shape, the <i>smoothing out</i> of all scratches
and the <i>facetting</i> and <i>polishing</i> are done somewhat
similarly by all lapidaries.</p>

<p>Having now had a glimpse of the methods
of the lapidaries, let us briefly consider
what constitutes good "make" in stones other
than diamond.</p>

<p><b>Good "Make" in Colored Stones.</b> Brilliants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
cut from materials having smaller refractive
indices than diamond, (and this group
includes nearly all stones other than diamonds)
should have steeper back angles and higher
tops than the best diamond brilliants have. A
35-degree top angle (the angle between the slope
of the top and the plane of the girdle is called
the top angle) and a 41-degree back angle
being about ideal for diamond, other gem
materials should have more nearly a 39-degree
top angle and a 44-degree back angle to give
the greatest possible brilliancy. However, in
the case of colored gems such as ruby, sapphire,
etc., where the value depends even more largely
upon the color than upon the brilliancy, it is
frequently necessary to cut the brilliant thicker
or thinner than these proportions in order to
deepen or to thin the color.</p>

<p>In general, the thicker a stone of a given
spread the deeper the color will be. The
color may also be deepened by giving to the
stone a rounded contour, both above and below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the girdle, and facetting it in steps instead of in
the brilliant form. Increasing the number of
steps also serves to slightly deepen the color, as a
larger number of reflections is thus obtained
within the material, the light thus has to
travel a greater distance through the colored
mass, and more of the light, of color
other than that of the stone, is absorbed.</p>

<p><b>Improving Color by Proper Cutting.</b> In
addition to the color improvement that can be
brought about by changing the shape of the cut
stone there are a number of gem materials whose
color varies very greatly in different directions,
and this fact calls for skillful use in order to
obtain the best possible results. Thus most
tourmalines of deep color must be cut with the
top or table, of the finished stone, on the <i>side</i>
of the prismatic crystal rather than at right
angles to the axis of the prism. If cut the
latter way they would be much too dense in
color. On the other hand, most blue sapphires
should be cut <i>across</i> the prism axis rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the way that tourmalines should be cut. To
cut a sapphire with its table on the side of the
prism would be likely to cause it to have a
greenish cast because of the admixture of the
unpleasing "ordinary ray" of yellowish tint
with the blue of the stone as seen up and down
the prism. Some Australian sapphires are of
a pronounced green when viewed across the
axis of the crystal.</p>

<p>Rubies if cut, as was recommended for
sapphires, give a very pure and very deep red
color, but lack somewhat in the display of
dichroism given by rubies that are cut with
the table on the side of the crystal and parallel
to its axis. Lapidaries need to know and to
make use of such optical relations as these and
jewelers might well inform themselves in such
matters, especially if they have, or hope to
acquire, trade in very fine colored stones.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Shape on Brilliancy.</b> In actual
practice it is common to find colored stones
poorly cut for brilliancy, especially central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
brilliancy, and that, too, without the excuse of
sacrifice of brilliancy in order to improve
color. The fault is usually due to too great a
desire to save size and weight. Frequently a
stone would have greater value if properly cut,
even at the expense of some size and weight.
When stones are cut too shallow, as is frequently
the case, they are sure to leak light in the center
and they are thus weak and less brilliant there
than they would be if made smaller in diameter
and with steeper back slopes approximating 44
degrees.</p>

<p>Round stones, if their angles are correct, are
more brilliant than stones of other contour such
as square or cushion shape, or navette or heart
shape. It can readily be seen that such odd-shaped
stones can hardly have the same top and
back angles at every part of their circumference.
If the angle from a corner of a square stone is
correct then the angle from the middle of one
side is obviously a little different. Small differences
of angle make considerable differences in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the brilliancy of cut stones. The prevailing
tendency to cut nearly all diamonds round
depends largely upon the above facts. In the
case of colored stones, however, the added attractiveness
which comes with odd or different
contour more than makes up for the slight loss
of brilliancy that may attend upon the shape
selected. Such shapes as lend themselves
to special designs in mountings also justify
any little loss in brilliancy that accompanies
the change in shape, provided the proportions
retained give a considerable amount of total
reflection within the stone and thus light up
most of the stone as seen from the front.</p>

<p>The test of the "make" of a color stone
is its appearance. If it lights up well over most
of its surface and if the color is right, one should
not criticize the "make" as one would be justified
in doing in the case of a diamond. If, however,
the effect is less attractive it would many
times be advisable to measure the angles
of the stone, or its thickness and spread as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
compared with similar measurements on a stone
of fine appearance. Frequently one will thus
find the reason for the failure of the stone to perform
as it might, and recutting should be resorted
to in such cases in order to get a smaller but
more beautiful and hence more valuable stone.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXIV</h2>

<h3>FORMS GIVEN TO PRECIOUS STONES</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">While</span> precious stones are cut to many
different forms, there are, nevertheless,
but a few general types of cutting. These
may be classified as follows: First, the "<i>cabochon</i>"
(<a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>) type of cutting; second, the old
"<i>rose</i>" (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>) type of cutting; third, the
<i>brilliant</i> (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>); fourth, the <i>step cutting</i> (<a href="#fig14">Fig.
14</a>).</p>

<p><b>Cabochons.</b> Of these the first, or <i>cabochon</i>
cutting, is probably the most ancient. The
term comes from a French word signifying
a bald pate (caboche, from Latin cabo, a head).
The usual round cabochon cut closely resembles
the top of a head in shape. Cabochon cut
stones usually have a flat base, but sometimes a
slightly convex base is used, especially in opals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and in moonstones, and some stones of very
dense color are cut with a concave base to thin
them and thus to reduce their color. The contour
of the base may be round, or oval, or square,
or cushion shape, or heart shape or of any regular
form. The top is always smooth and
rounding and unfacetted. The relation of
the height or thickness to the length or width
may be varied to suit the size and shape of the
rough piece or to suit one's ideas of symmetry,
provided the material be an opaque one, such as
turquoise or lapis lazuli. If, however, the
material is transparent the best results in the
way of the return of light to the front, and hence
in the display of the color of the material, are
had if the thickness is about one half the spread.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 309px;"><a name="fig11" id="fig11"></a>
<img src="images/013.png" width="309" height="107" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;CABOCHON CUTTING.</div>

<p>This relation depends upon the refractive
index of the material, but as most color
stones are of somewhat similar refractive indices,
the above proportions are sufficiently accurate
for all. The object in view is the securing of
total reflection of as much light as possible
from the flat polished back of the stone. Cabochon
stones are sometimes set over foil or on
polished gold to increase the reflection of
light.</p>

<p>The path of a ray of light through a cabochon
cut stone is closely similar to that through a rose
cut diamond [see cut (c) of <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a> for the latter.]
Like the rose cut, the cabochon cut does not
give much brilliancy as compared to the brilliant
cut. Cabochon cut stones, however,
have a quiet beauty of color which commends
them to people of quiet taste, and even fine
rubies, sapphires, and emeralds are increasingly
cut cabochon to satisfy the growing demand
for fine taste in jewels. The East Indian has
all along preferred the cabochon cut for color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
stones, but possibly his motives have not
been unmixed, as the cabochon cut saves
a greater proportion of the weight of the rough
stone than the more modern types of cutting.</p>

<p>Garnets, more than other stones, have
been used in the cabochon cut, and when
in that form are usually known as <i>carbuncles</i>
(from carbunculus, a glowing coal). Any other
fiery red stone might equally well be styled a
carbuncle, especially if cabochon cut.</p>

<div class="figc"><a name="fig12" id="fig12"></a>
<img src="images/014.png" width="314" height="99" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 12.&mdash;ROSE CUTTING.</div>

<p>Scientific rubies look very well in the cabochon
cut.</p>

<p><a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a> shows in (a) and (b) the front and
top of the usual round cabochon. Cut (c)
of the same figure gives the front elevation of a
cabochon which will light up better than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
usual round-topped design. In the round-topped
type the central part of the top is so
nearly parallel to the back that light can pass
right through as through a window pane. If the
sloping sides are brought up to a blunt point, as
in cut (c) there is very much less loss of light
and greater beauty results. The East Indian
cabochons are frequently cut in a fashion resembling
that suggested.</p>

<img src="images/015.png" width="318" height="104" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;BRILLIANT CUTTING.</div>

<p><b>Rose Cut Stones.</b> It was natural that the
earliest cut stones should have the simple
rounded lines of the cabochon cutting, for the
first thing that would occur to the primitive
worker who aspired to improve upon nature's
product, would be the rubbing down of sharp
edges and the polishing of the whole surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the stone. Perhaps the next improvement was
the polishing of flat facets upon the rounded
top of a cabochon stone. This process gives
us the ancient type of cutting known as the
<i>rose</i> cut. The drawings (a) and (b) of <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>
show the front elevation and the top and (c)
shows the path of a ray of light through a "rose."
It will be noted that the general shape resembles
that of a round cabochon, but twenty-four triangular
facets have been formed upon the top.
The well-proportioned rose has a thickness about
one half as great as its diameter. Diamonds
were formerly cut chiefly in the rose form,
especially in the days of the East Indian mines,
and even in the early part of the nineteenth
century many people preferred finely made
roses to the thick, clumsy brilliants of that day.
To-day only very small pieces of diamond
are cut to "roses." As the material so used
frequently results from the cleaving of larger
diamonds, the public has come to know these
tiny roses as "chips."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The best roses have twenty-four regular facets
but small ones frequently receive only twelve,
and those are seldom regular in shape and in
arrangement. Such roses serve well enough
for encrusting watch cases and for similar work,
as the flat base of the stone can be set in thin
metal without difficulty. About the only gem
other than diamond that is now cut to the
rose form is garnet. Large numbers of small
Bohemian garnets are cut to crude rose form
for use in cluster work.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 14.&mdash;STEP CUTTING.</div>

<p><b>The brilliant cut</b>, as its name implies, gives
the most complete return of light of any of
the forms of cutting. The theory of the brilliant
has already been discussed (<a href="#LESSON_XXII">Lesson XXII.</a>
in connection with the cutting of diamond). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
shape of the brilliant is too well known to require
much description. Most brilliants to-day are
cut practically round and the form is that of two
truncated cones placed base to base. The upper
cone is truncated more than the lower, thus forming
the large, flat top facet known as the <i>table</i> of
the stone [A, <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>, cut (a)]. The truncating
of the lower cone forms the tiny facet known as
the culet, which lies opposite to the table and
is parallel to the latter [see B, <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>, cut (a)].
The edge of meeting of the two cones is the
<i>girdle</i> of the brilliant [CD in cut (a), <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>].
The sloping surface of the upper cone is facetted
with thirty-two facets in the full cut brilliant,
while the lower cone receives twenty-four.</p>

<p>Small stones sometimes receive fewer facets,
to lessen the cost and difficulty of cutting,
but by paying sufficient for them full cut brilliants
as small as one hundred to the carat may
be had. Cut (b) of <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a> shows the proper
arrangement of the top facets and cut (c) that
of the bottom facets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>When cutting colored stones in the brilliant
cut, especially if the material is very
costly and its color in need of being darkened
or lightened, the lapidary frequently
takes liberties with the regular arrangement
and proportions depicted in the cuts.</p>

<p><b>Step Cutting.</b> The only remaining type of
cutting that is in very general use is the <i>step cut</i>
(sometimes known as trap cut). <a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>,
(a), (b), and (c), shows the front elevation, the
top and the back of a square antique step cut
stone. The contour may be round or completely
square or oblong or of some other shape, just
as a brilliant may have any of these contours.
The distinctive feature of the step cutting is the
several series of parallel-edged quadrangular
facets above and below the girdle and the
generally rounding character of its cross section.
This plump, rounding character permits the saving
of weight of the rough material, and by massing
the color gives usually a greater depth of
color than a brilliant of the same spread would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
have if cut from similar material. While probably
never quite as snappy and brilliant as the
regular brilliant cut, a well-proportioned step
cut stone can be very brilliant. Many fine
diamonds have recently been cut in steps for use
in exclusive jewelry.</p>

<p><b>The Mixed Cut.</b> The ruby and the emerald
are never better in color than when in the full
step cut, although rubies are frequently cut in
what is known as the <i>mixed</i> cut, consisting of
a brilliant cut top and a step cut back. Sapphires
and many other colored stones are
commonly cut in the mixed cut. Recently it
has become common to polish the tops of colored
stones with a smooth unfacetted, slightly
convex surface, the back being facetted in
either the brilliant or the step arrangement.
Such stones are said to have a "<i>buffed top</i>."
They are less expensive to cut than fully facetted
stones and do not have the snappy brilliancy
of the latter. They do, however, show off the
intrinsic color of the material very well.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_XXV" id="LESSON_XXV"></a>LESSON XXV</h2>

<h3>IMITATIONS OF PRECIOUS STONES</h3>

<p><b>"Paste" Gems.</b> Large volumes have been
written on paste jewels, especially on antique
pastes. Contrary to a prevailing belief, the
paste gem is not a recent invention. People
frequently say when told that their gems
are false, "But it is a very old piece, it must be
genuine." The great age of a jewel should
rather lead to suspicion that it was not genuine
than give confidence that a true gem was
assured. The Egyptians and Romans were
skillful makers of glass of the sort used in
imitating gems and some of the old pastes were
very hard or else have become so with age.</p>

<p>Glass of one variety or another makes the
most convincing sort of imitation precious
stones. The term "paste" as applied to glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
imitations is said to come from the Italian
<i>pasta</i> meaning dough, and it suggests the softness
of the material. Most pastes are mainly
lead glass. As we saw in <a href="#LESSON_XVIII">Lesson XVIII.</a>, on the
chemical composition of the gems, many of them
are silicates of metals. Now glasses are also
silicates of various metals, but unlike gem
minerals the glasses are not crystalline but
rather amorphous, that is, without definite
geometric form or definite internal arrangement.</p>

<p>The optical properties of the various glasses
vary chiefly with their densities, and the denser
the material the higher the refractive index
and the greater the dispersion. Thus to get the
best results in imitation stones they should be
made of very heavy glass. The dense flint glass
(chiefly a silicate of potassium and lead) which is
used for cut glass ware illustrates admirably
the optical properties of the heavy glasses.
By using even more lead a still denser glass may
be had, with even a greater brilliancy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the addition of lead or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
heavy metals (such as thallium) makes the
product very soft and also very subject to attack
by gases such as are always present in the
atmosphere of cities. This softness causes
the stones to scratch readily so that when worn
they soon lose their polish and with the loss of
polish they lose their beauty. The attack of the
gases before mentioned darkens the surfaces
of the imitation and further dulls it. When
fresh and new a well cut piece of colorless
paste has a snap and fire that approaches
that of diamond. The surface luster is not
adamantine, however, and the edges of the
facets cannot be polished so sharply as those
on a diamond. Moreover the refractive index,
while high, is never so high as in a diamond
and hence the brilliant cannot be so shaped
as to secure the amount of total reflection given
by a well-made diamond. Hence, the paste
brilliant, while quite satisfying as seen from
squarely in front, is weak and dark in the center
as seen when tilted to one side. By these differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the trained eye can detect paste imitations
of diamond at a glance without recourse
to tests of specific gravity, hardness, etc.</p>

<p>Pastes, being amorphous, are singly refracting,
as is diamond. This fact helps
the appearance of the paste brilliant, for light
does not divide within it to become weakened
in power. This singleness of refraction, however,
betrays the paste imitation when it is
colored to resemble ruby, sapphire or emerald,
all of which are doubly refracting.</p>

<p>The color is imparted to pastes by the
addition, during their manufacture, of various
metallic oxides in small proportions. Thus
cobalt gives a blue color, copper or chromium
green, copper or gold give red (under proper
treatment) and manganese gives purple. By
experiment the makers of pastes have become
very skillful in imitating the color of almost
any precious stone. Fine paste emeralds may
look better than inferior genuine emeralds.</p>

<p>As pastes are singly refracting and hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
lack dichroism, the pleasing variety of color
of the true ruby cannot be had in a paste
imitation, but the public is not critical enough
to notice this lack. The expert would, however,
note it and could detect the imitation by that
difference as well as by the lack of double
refraction. The use of direct sunlight and a
white card as already explained in the lesson
on double refraction (<a href="#LESSON_III">Lesson III.</a>) will serve to
expose the singleness of refraction of paste
imitations. Spinels and garnets are about the
only true gems (except diamond) that are
single refracting. Any other color stone should
show double refraction when tested by the sunlight-card
method. The file test will also
expose any paste imitation as all the very
brilliant pastes are fairly soft.</p>

<p><b>Doublets.</b> To give better wearing quality to
paste imitations the <i>doublet</i> was devised. This
name is used because the product is in two
parts, a lower or back portion of paste and
an upper or top portion of some cheap but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
hard genuine stone. Garnet is probably used
for this purpose to a greater extent than any
other material, although quartz or colorless
topaz will do very well.</p>

<p>The usual arrangement of the parts can
be seen in <a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>, the garnet covering only
a part of the upper surface, namely the table
part and a small portion of the sloping surface
of the top. In high class doublets the hard
mineral covers the paste to the girdle. (See
<a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>.) The color of the garnet does not
interfere seriously with that of the paste.</p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 257px;"><a name="fig15" id="fig15"></a>
<img src="images/017.png" width="257" height="112" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 15. ONE FORM OF CHEAP DOUBLET.</div>

<p>If a "diamond" doublet is desired the
slice of garnet is made nearly as thin as paper
and it covers only the table of the brilliant. It
is thus practically colorless. A thin slice of red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
garnet over a green background is not noticeable,
as all the red is absorbed in passing
through the green material beneath. With a
blue base, the red upper layer may give a
very slight purple effect. With yellow a
slight orange tint results and of course with
a red back no perceptible difference would
result.</p>

<div class="figc" style="width: 266px;"><a name="fig16" id="fig16"></a>
<img src="images/018.png" width="266" height="124" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 16. ANOTHER FORM OF DOUBLET.</div>

<p>The two materials are cemented together,
by means of a transparent waterproof cement.
The <i>triplet</i> has already been described in <a href="#LESSON_XII">Lesson
XII</a>. It is even better than the doublet and
more difficult to detect. Both the file test and
the sunlight-card test serve to detect doublets,
as well as paste imitations, except that in the file
test with the fully protected doublet the <i>back</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the stone must be tested with the file, as the
girdle and top are of hard material.</p>

<p>In the sunlight-card test of a doublet (the
refraction of garnet being single like that of
glass), single images of the facets will be had on
the card when the sunlight is reflected onto
it. A reflection of the lower or inner surface
of the garnet top can be seen also and this
serves to still further identify a doublet or
a triplet. The appearance of this reflection
is much like that received on the card from
the top of the table. It is larger than the
reflections of the smaller facets and is but
little colored.</p>

<p><b>Tests for Doublets.</b> A trained eye can also
detect a doublet or a triplet by noting the
difference in the character of the surface luster
of the garnet part and of the glass part. Garnet
takes a keener and more resinous luster than
glass. By tipping the doublet so that light is
reflected to the eye from the sloping top surface,
one can see at once where the garnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
leaves off and the glass begins. Even through
a show window one can tell a doublet in this way
although here it is necessary to move oneself,
instead of the stone, until a proper position
is obtained to get a reflection from the top slope
of the doublet.</p>

<p>If the garnet covers the whole top of the
imitation then it is not possible to get so direct
a comparison, but even here one can look first
at the top surface and then at the back and thus
compare the luster. It is also well to closely
examine with a lens the region of the girdle, to
see if any evidence of the joining of two materials
can be seen. Frequently the lapidary
bevels the edge so as to bring the line of junction
between real and false material at the sharp
edge of the bevel. Boiling a doublet in alcohol or
chloroform will frequently dissolve the cement
and separate the parts.</p>

<p>The dichroscope also serves to detect the
false character of doublets and paste imitations,
as neither shows dichroism. As rubies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
emeralds, sapphires, and in fact most colored
stones of value, show distinct dichroism, this
test is a sure one against these imitations.</p>

<p>Triplets and doublets too may be exposed by
dipping them <i>sidewise</i> into oil, thus removing
the prismatic refraction almost completely, as the
oil has about the same refractive index as the
stone. One can then look directly through
glass and garnet, or other topping material,
separately, and each material then shows its
proper color. Thus zones of color appear in
a doublet or triplet when under the oil. A
real gem would appear almost uniform in color
under these conditions.</p>

<p>Round gas bubbles can frequently be found
in paste, and hence in the paste part of a doublet.
Also, the natural flaws of the real stone are
never found in paste, but may be present in the
real stone part of a doublet or a triplet. Some
imitation emeralds on the market, however,
have been made in a way to counterfeit the
flaws and faults generally found in this stone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Altered Stones.</b> In addition to the out and
out imitations made of paste, and the doublets,
there are numerous imitations current in the
trade that are made by staining or by otherwise
altering the color of some genuine but inexpensive
gem material.</p>

<p>For example, large quantities of somewhat
porous chalcedony from Brazil are stained
and sold in imitation of natural agate or sard
or other stones. In many cases the staining
is superficial, so that the stone has to be
shaped before it is stained, then stained and
polished.</p>

<p>Large quantities of slightly crackled quartz
are stained to resemble lapis lazuli, and sold,
usually with the title "Swiss Lapis." A file
test will reveal the character of this imitation,
as it is harder than a file, while true lapis is
softer. The color too is never of so fine a blue
as that of fine lapis. It has a Prussian blue
effect.</p>

<p>Turquoises of inferior color are also sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
stained to improve them. A better
product is made artificially.</p>

<p>Opals are sometimes impregnated with organic
matter, which is then charred, perhaps
with sulphuric acid, thus giving them somewhat
the appearance of black opal.</p>

<p>Opals are also imitated by adding oxide
of tin to glass, thus imparting a slight milkiness
to it. The imitation is then shaped from this
glass by molding, and the back of the cabochon
is given an irregular surface, which may be set
over tinsel to give the effect of "fire."</p>

<p>Pale stones are frequently mounted over
foil, or in enameled or stained settings and
thus their color is seemingly improved.</p>

<p>Diamonds of poor color are occasionally
"painted"; often the back of the brilliant is
treated with a violet dyestuff, which even in
so small an amount that it is difficult to detect,
will neutralize the yellow of the stone and make
it appear to be of a fine blue-white color. The
"painting" is, of course, not permanent, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
that such treatment of a diamond with a view
to selling it is fraudulent. The painted stone
may be detected by washing it with alcohol,
when the dye will be removed and the off-color
will become apparent. If the stone is unset
one can see with a lens a wavery metallic
appearance on the surfaces that have been
"painted." This effect is due to the action
of the very thin film of dye upon the light that
falls upon it.</p>

<p>Besides the staining of genuine materials,
they are sometimes altered in color by heat
treatment, and this topic will be discussed
in the next lesson.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>
<h2>LESSON XXVI</h2>

<h3>ALTERATION OF THE COLOR OF PRECIOUS STONES</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Many</span> gem minerals change color when
more or less strongly heated. Extreme
heat whitens many colored materials completely.</p>

<p><b>"Pinked Topaz."</b> John Ruskin advises us
to "seek out and cast aside all manner of false
or dyed or altered stones" but, in spite of his
advice, perhaps the most justifiable use of heat
treatment is that which alters the color of
true topaz from a wine-yellow to a fine pink.
It would appear that the wine-yellow is a composite
color composed of pink and yellow and
that the pink constituent is less easily changed
by heat than is the yellow one. If too high a
temperature is used both colors disappear and
white topaz results. As the latter is abundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
in nature and of little value, such a result is very
undesirable. Pink topaz, however, is very
rare, and until recently, when pink tourmaline
from California and Madagascar, and pink
beryl (morganite) from Madagascar, became
available in quantity, the "pinked" topazes
had but few competing gems, and thus commanded
a higher price than the natural topazes.
Of course, care has to be taken in heating a
mineral to raise and lower the temperature
slowly, in order to avoid sudden and unequal
expansion or contraction, which would crack
and ruin the specimen, as the writer learned to
his sorrow with the first topaz that he tried to
"pink."</p>

<p><b>Spanish Topaz.</b> Another material that gains
a more valuable color by heat treatment is the
smoky quartz of Spain, which, on being gently
heated, yields the so-called Spanish topaz.
Some amethysts are altered to a yellow color
by mild heating. Too great a temperature
completely decolorizes colored quartz. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
dark quartz yields a nearly garnet red product,
after heating.</p>

<p><b>Zircon.</b> Slight increase in temperature
causes many of the zircons from Ceylon to
change markedly in color. An alcohol flame
serves admirably to effect the change, care
being taken to warm up the stone very gradually
and to cool it slowly. Drafts should be
prevented, as they might suddenly cool the
stone and crack it. Some zircons become
completely whitened by this treatment. At
the same time they increase markedly in density
and in refractive index and thus become even
more snappy and brilliant than when colored.
One is tempted to suspect that the "space
lattice" of the crystal has had its strata drawn
closer together during the heating and left
permanently in a closer order of arrangement.
Other zircons merely become lighter colored
and less attractive. Some of the whitened
stones again become more or less colored on
exposure to strong light. Ultra-violet light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
will sometimes restore these to a fine deep color
in a short time.</p>

<p>The whitened zircon, when finely cut in the
brilliant form, with truly flat facets and sharp
edges and with a top angle of about 39 degrees
and a back angle of about 44 degrees, so closely
resembles a diamond that it will deceive almost
anyone on casual inspection. The expert, even,
may be deceived, if caught off his guard. The
writer has a fine specimen of a little over one
carat, with which he has deceived many jewelers
and pawnbrokers, and even an importer or
two. If it is presented as a stone that closely
resembles diamond your expert will say: "Yes,
it is pretty good, but it would never fool me."
If, however, you catch him off his guard by
suggesting, perhaps, "Did you ever see a diamond
with a polished girdle?", then he will look
at it with interest, remark on its fine color and
"make," and never think of challenging its
character.</p>

<p>The refractive index of the dense type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of zircon is so high (1.92-1.98) that it lights up
well over most of the surface of the brilliant
when cut, as above indicated, and does not
show markedly the weak dark center shown by
white sapphire, white topaz, colorless quartz,
colorless beryl, and paste, when seen from the
side. Moreover, the luster of zircon is nearly
adamantine, so the expert does not miss the cold
metallic glitter as he would with any other
white stone. The color dispersion, too, is
so high (86% as great as in diamond) that the
zircon has considerable "fire," and thus the
casual handler is again deceived. A fine white
zircon is really prettier than a <i>poor</i> diamond.
It cannot compare, however, with a <i>fine</i> diamond.
It would never do to let an expert see
your zircon beside even a fair diamond. The
zircon would look "sleepy." It is only when no
direct comparison is possible, and when the
expert is not suspicious, that a zircon can
deceive him. Of course, the use of the scientific
tests of the earlier lessons will, at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
detect the character of a whitened zircon. The
hardness is but 7.5, the refraction so strongly
double that the edges of the back facets appear
double-lined when viewed through the table
with a lens, and the specific gravity is 4.69.
Double spots of light appear on the card when
the sunlight-card test is applied. Hence, it is
easy to detect zircon by any of these tests
if there is reason to suspect that it has been
substituted for diamond.</p>

<p><b>Corundum Gems.</b> Rubies of streaky color
are said to be improved by careful heating.
Usually ruby undergoes a series of color changes
on being heated, but returns through the same
series in reverse order on being cooled, and
finally resumes its original color. Strong heating
will whiten some yellow sapphire. The
author thus obtained a white sapphire from a
crystal of light yellow material.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the corundum
gems undergo marked change in color
under the influence of radium. A regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
series of changes is said to be produced in
white sapphire by this means, the final color
being yellow. This color may then be removed
by heat and the series run through
again. It is not stated that a fine red has
ever been thus obtained. Perhaps Nature,
by her slower methods, using the faint traces
of radio-active material in the rocks, reddens
the corundum of Burmah at her leisure, and
finally arrives at the much sought "pigeon
blood" color. It is said that the natives of
India have a legend to the effect that the white
sapphires of the mines are "ripening rubies,"
and that one day they will mature. Perhaps
they are not far wrong.</p>

<p><b>Diamond.</b> Diamonds of yellowish tint may
be improved in color by the use of high-power
radium. At present the latter is so rare and
costly that there is no evidence of its commercial
use for this purpose. Scientists have brought
about the change to a light blue as an experiment.
It is not yet known whether the change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
will be permanent. Perhaps here again Nature
has anticipated man's discovery and made the
fine bluish-violet Brazilian diamonds (which
fluoresce to a deep violet under an arc light,
and which shine for a few moments in the dark
after exposure to light) by associating them for
ages with radio-active material. Some of the
African stones also have these characteristics.</p>

<p>Aside from the change in the color of diamond
that may be brought about by means of radium,
the mineral is extremely reluctant to alter its
color. Many experimenters besides the author
have tried in vain a host of expedients in the
hope of finding some way to improve the color of
diamond. About the only noticeable alteration
that the author has been able to bring
about was upon a brown diamond, the color
of which was made somewhat lighter and more
ashen by heating it in a current of hydrogen
gas to a low red heat.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXVII</h2>

<h3>PEARLS</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Unlike</span> the gems that have been so far
considered, the pearl is not a mineral,
but is of organic origin, that is, it is the product
of a living organism. There are two principal
types of molluscs which yield true pearls in
commercial quantities. The best known of
the first type is the so-called pearl oyster
(<i>Meleagrina margaritifera</i>). The pearl mussel
of fresh water streams is of the second type
(<i>Unio margaritifera</i>). Other species of molluscs
having pearly linings to their shells may produce
pearls, but most of the pearls of commerce come
from one or the other of the two varieties
mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Structure of Pearl.</b> The structure and material
of the true pearl must be first understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
in order to understand the underlying reasons
for the remarkable beauty of this gem. Pearls
are composed partly of the mineral substance
calcium carbonate (chemically the same as
marble) and partly of a tough, horny substance
of organic nature called conchiolin.
The shell of the pearl-bearing mollusc is also
composed of these two substances. Calcium
carbonate may crystallize in either of two forms,
calcite or aragonite. In marble we have calcite.
In the outer portions of the shell of the
pearl oyster the calcium carbonate is in the form
of calcite, but in the inner nacreous lining and in
the pearl itself the mineral is present as aragonite.
This is deposited by the mollusc
in very thin crystalline layers in the horny
layers of conchiolin, so that the lining of the
shell is built of approximately parallel layers
of mineral and of animal substance. In the
normal shell this is all that takes place, but in
the case of a mollusc whose interior is invaded
by any small source of irritation, such as a borer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
or a grain of sand, or other bit of foreign material,
a process of alternate deposit of conchiolin
and of aragonite goes on upon the invading
matter, thus forming a pearl.</p>

<p>The pearl is built in layers like an onion. In
shape it may be spherical, or pear-shaped, or
button-shaped or of any less regular shape
than these. The regular shapes are more
highly valued. The spherical shape is of greatest
value, other things being equal. Next
comes the drop or pear shape, then the button
shape, and after these the host of irregular shapes
known to the jeweler as "baroques." The
river man who gathers mussels calls these odd-shaped
pearls "slugs."</p>

<p>Let us now attempt to understand how the
beautiful luster and iridescence of the pearl
are related to the layer-like structure of the gem.
In the first place, it should be understood
that both conchiolin and aragonite are translucent,
that is, they pass light to a certain extent.
The layers being exceedingly thin, light can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
penetrate a considerable number of them if not
otherwise deflected from its course. We thus
obtain reflections not merely from the outer surface
of a pearl, but from layer after layer
within the gem and all these reflections reach
the eye in a blended reflection of great beauty.
The luster of a pearl is then not purely a <i>surface
luster</i> in the usual sense of that term, but it is a
luster due to many superposed surfaces. It is
so different from other types of luster that we
describe it merely as <i>pearly luster</i> even though
we find it in some other material, as, for example
in certain sapphires, in which it is due to a
similar layer-like arrangement of structure.</p>

<p><b>Orient.</b> The fineness of the luster of a pearl,
or as is said in the trade, the <i>orient</i>, depends
upon the number of layers that take part
in the reflection, and this number in turn
depends upon the translucency of the material
and the thinness of the layers. Very
fine pearls usually have very many, very
thin layers taking part in the reflection. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
degree of translucency, considered apart, is
sometimes called the "water" of the
pearl.</p>

<p>In addition to their beautiful luster, many
pearls display iridescence, and this is due in
part, as in the case of the pearly lining of the
shell (mother of pearl) to overlapping of successive
layers, like the overlapping of shingles
on a roof. This gives rise to a lined surface,
much like the diffraction grating of the physicist,
which is made by ruling a glass plate with
thousands of parallel lines to the inch. Such a
grating produces wonderful spectra, in which
the rainbow colors are widely separated and
very vivid. The principal on which this separation
of light depends is known as diffraction
and cannot be explained here, but a similar
effect takes place when light falls on the naturally
ruled surface of a pearl and helps produce
the play of colors known as iridescence. The
thin layers themselves also help to produce the
iridescence by interference of light much as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the case of the opal, which has already been
discussed.</p>

<p><b>Color.</b> Having explained the cause of the
orient and water of pearls, the <i>color</i> must next
be considered. Pearls may be had of almost
any color, but the majority of fine pearls are
white, or nearly so. The fine Oriental pearls
frequently have a creamy tint. Among fresh
water pearls the creamy tint is less often seen,
but fine pink tints occur. Occasionally a black
pearl is found and on account of its rarity commands
a price nearly as great as that obtainable
for a white pearl of similar size and quality.</p>

<p>The value of pearls depends upon several
different factors and it is far from an easy matter
to estimate the value of a fine specimen. It is
much easier to grade and estimate the value of
diamonds than to do the same for pearls, and it
is only by long and intimate acquaintance with
the pearls themselves that one can hope to
become expert in deciding values. There are,
however, several general factors that govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the value of pearls. Chief among these are:
1, <i>Orient</i>; 2, <i>Color</i>; 3, <i>Texture or Skin</i>; 4, <i>Shape
and Size</i>.</p>

<p><b>Factors Governing the Value of Pearls.</b> Taking
up each of these factors in turn, it may be
said of the first that unless a pearl has that fine
keen luster known as a fine orient, it is of but
limited value. No matter what the size, or
how perfect the shape, it is nothing, if dead and
lusterless. To have great value the gem must
gleam with that soft but lively luster peculiar to
fine specimens of pearl. With variations in
orient go wide variations in value.</p>

<p>As to <i>color</i>, the choicest pearls are pure white
or delicate rose pink or creamy white. Pearls
in these shades can be had in numbers and these
colors are what might be called <i>regular</i> colors.
<i>Fancy-colored</i> pearls have peculiar and irregular
values, depending a good deal upon rarity
and upon the obtaining of a customer for an
odd color. Fine pink and fine black pearls are
examples of the type that is meant here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>To be very valuable a pearl must have
a smooth even <i>skin</i>, that is, the <i>texture</i> of
its surface must be even and regular. It must
not have pits or scratches or wrinkles, or little
raised spots upon it, or any cracks in it. In
connection with this topic of "skin," it may be
mentioned that it is sometimes true that a pearl
of bad skin or of poor luster may be improved
markedly by "peeling" it, as the process is
called. As was said above, a pearl is built in
layers much like an onion, and it can often be
peeled, that is, one or more layers can be
removed, thus exposing fresh layers beneath,
whose texture and luster may be better than
those of the original outside layer.</p>

<p><b>"Peeling" a Pearl.</b> Possibly an anecdote
of an actual case may serve best to explain the
method by which "peeling" is sometimes
accomplished. The writer was once at Vincennes,
Ind., on business, and there became
acquainted with a pearl buyer who was stopping
at that place to buy fresh water pearls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
"slugs" from the rivermen who gather the
mussels for the sake of their shells. The
latter are made into "pearl" buttons for
clothing. It happened that the pearl buyer
had accumulated some twenty-eight ounces of
slugs and a number of pearls and was leaving
on the same train with the author, who shared
his seat with him. While we were looking
over the slugs together the pearl buyer put his
hand in his pocket and drew out a five-dollar
bill which he unrolled, exposing a pearl of about
six grains, well shaped, but of rather dead
luster. Remarking that he had paid but $4 for
it and that he had rolled it up in the bill for safe
keeping until he got time to peel it, he took out
a small penknife, opened one of the blades,
put a couple of kid glove finger tips on the
thumb and first finger of his left hand and
proceeded to peel the pearl on the moving
train. Holding his two hands together to steady
them, he pressed the edge of his knife blade
against the pearl until the harder steel had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
penetrated straight down through one layer.
Then with a flaking, lateral motion he flaked off
a part of the outer skin. Bit by bit all of the
outer layer was flaked off, and that, too, without
appreciably scratching the next layer, so
great was the worker's skill. When the pearl
was completely peeled it was gently rubbed with
three grades of polishing paper, each finer than
the previous one, and then the writer was
allowed to examine it. The appearance had
been much improved, although it was not of
extremely fine quality even when peeled. Under
a high power magnifier scarcely a trace of the
peeling could be seen. The value of the $4 pearl
had been raised to at least $100 and not many
minutes had been required for the change.
A slower and more laborious, but safer, process
of "peeling" a pearl, consists in gently rubbing
the surface with a very fine, rather soft, abrasive
powder until all of the outer skin has been thus
worn away.</p>

<p>Of course, in many such cases no better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
skin than the outer one could be found and
disappointment would result from the peeling
of such a pearl. It should be added that it will
not do to try to peel a <i>part</i> of a pearl in order
to remove an excrescence, for then one would
inevitably cut across the layers, exposing their
edges, and such a surface looks, when polished,
much like a pearl button, but not like a pearl.</p>

<p>In this connection may be mentioned the
widespread belief on the part of the public
that the concretions found in the common edible
oyster can be polished by a lapidary, as a rough
precious stone can be improved by the latter, and
that a fine pearl will result. It is frequently
necessary for jewelers to whom such "pearls"
are brought, to undeceive the person bringing
them and to tell him that only those molluscs
that have a beautiful pearly lining to their
shells are capable of producing true pearls and
that the latter require no assistance from
the lapidary.</p>

<p><b>Shape.</b> To return to the topic of factors governing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the value of pearls, the <i>shape</i> of the
pearl makes a vast difference in the value.
Perfectly spherical pearls are most highly
valued and closely following come those of
drop or pear shape, as this shape lends itself
nicely to the making of pendants. Oval or egg-shaped
pearls are also good. After these come
the button shapes, in which one side is flattened.
Pearls of irregular shape are much less highly
valued. The irregular-shaped pearls are called
<i>baroque</i> pearls in the trade. The rivermen
engaged in the fresh water pearl fishery call
them <i>slugs</i>. Some of the more regular of
these are called "nuggets." Others are termed
"spikes" because of their pointed shape, and
still others are called "wing" pearls on account
of their resemblance to a bird's wing. Most of
the baroques are too irregular in shape to have
any special name applying to their form.</p>

<p><b>Weight.</b> After orient, color, skin, and shape
have been considered, <i>size</i> or <i>weight</i> finally determines
the value. Pearls are sold by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
arbitrary unit of weight known as the <i>pearl
grain</i>. It is not equal to the grain avoirdupois,
but is one fourth of a diamond carat. As the
new metric carat is one fifth of a gram and as
there are 15.43 avoirdupois grains in a gram, it
is seen at once that there are but 3.08 real
grains in a carat rather than four. Thus
the <i>pearl grain</i> is slightly lighter than the
avoirdupois grain.</p>

<p>Since large, fine pearls are exceedingly
rare, the value mounts with size much more
rapidly than is the case with any other gem;
in fact, the value increases as the <i>square</i> of the
weight. For example, let us consider two pearls,
one of one grain weight, the other of two grains,
and both of the same grade as to quality. If the
smaller is worth say $2 per grain, then the
larger is worth 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2 (the square of the weight)
times $2 (the <i>price per grain base</i>, as it is called
in the trade), which totals $8. A four-grain
pearl of this grade would be worth 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;$2&nbsp;=&nbsp;$32,
etc. Thus it is seen that the price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
increases very rapidly with increase in weight.</p>

<p><b>Price "Per Grain Base."</b> Some of the lower
grades of pearls in small sizes are sold by the
grain <i>straight</i>, that is, the price per grain is
merely multiplied by the weight in grains to get
the value, just as the price per carat would
be multiplied by the number of carats to get the
value of a diamond. This method of figuring
the value of pearls is used only for the cheaper
grades and small sizes, however, and the method
first explained, the calculation per grain <i>base</i>,
is the one in universal use for fine gems. Very
fine exceptional gems may be sold at a
large price <i>for the piece</i>, regardless of the
weight.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in this connection
that Tavernier, the French gem merchant of the
seventeenth century, tells us that in his day
the price of large diamonds was calculated by
a method similar to that which we now use
for pearls, that is, the weight in carats was
squared and the product multiplied by the price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
per carat. Such a method would give far too
high a price for diamonds to-day.</p>

<p><b>The High Price of Fine Pearls.</b> This suggests
the thought that pearls of fine quality and great
size are the most costly of all gems to-day and
yet there seems to be no halting in the demand
for them. In fact, America is only just beginning
to get interested in pearls and is coming
to esteem them as they have long been
esteemed in the East and in Europe. Those
who have thought that the advance in the
prices of diamonds in recent years will soon put
them at prohibitive rates should consider the
enormous prices that have been obtained and
are being obtained for fine pearls.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the calculating of prices
of pearls, tables have been computed and published
giving the values of pearls of all sizes at
different prices <i>per grain base</i>, and several times
these tables have been outgrown, and new ones,
running to higher values, have been made.
The present tables run to $50 per grain base.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>There is much justification for the high
prices demanded and paid for large and fine
pearls. Such gems are really exceedingly scarce.
Those who, as boys, have opened hundreds of
river mussels only to find a very few small,
badly misshapen "slugs" will realize that it is
only one mollusc in a very large number that
contains a fine pearl. Moreover, like the bison
and the wild pigeon, the pearl-bearing molluscs
may be greatly diminished in numbers or even
exterminated by the greed of man and his
fearfully destructive methods of harvesting
nature's productions. In fact, the fisheries
have been dwindling in yield for some time,
and most of the fine pearls that are marketed
are <i>old</i> pearls, already drilled, from the treasuries
of Eastern potentates, who have been forced by
necessity to accept the high prices offered by the
West for part of their treasures. In India, pearls
have long been acceptable collateral for loans,
and many fine gems have come on the market
after failure of the owners to repay such loans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Having considered the factors bearing on the
value of pearls, we will next consider briefly
their physical properties. The specific gravity
is less definite than with minerals and varies
between 2.65 and 2.70. It may be even higher
for pink pearls.</p>

<p><b>Physical Properties.</b> In hardness pearls also
vary, ranging between 3<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> and 4 on Mohs's
scale. They are thus very soft and easily worn
or scratched by hard usage. A case showing
the rather rapid wearing away of pearls recently
came to the attention of the writer. A pendant
in the shape of a Latin cross had been made
of round pearls which had been drilled and
strung on two slender gold rods to form the
cross. The pearls were free to rotate on the
wires. After a period of some twenty or more
years of wear the pearls had all become distinctly
cylindrical in shape, the rubbing against the
garments over which the pendant had been
worn having been sufficient to grind away
the soft material to that extent. The luster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
was still good, the pearls having virtually
been "peeled" very slowly by abrasion.</p>

<p><b>Care of Pearls.</b> This example suggests the
great care that should be taken by owners of
fine pearls to prevent undue rubbing or wear
of these valuable but not extremely durable
gems. They should be carefully wiped after
being worn to remove dust and then put away
in a tightly closed case.</p>

<p>Pearls should never be allowed to come in
contact with any acid, not even weak acids
like lemonade, or punch or vinegar, as, being
largely calcium carbonate they are very easily
acted upon by acids, and a mere touch with an
acid might ruin the surface luster. Being partly
organic in nature, pearls are not everlasting,
but must eventually decay, as is shown by the
powdery condition of very old pearls that have
been found with mummies or in ancient ruins.
The organic matter has yielded to bacterial
attack and decayed, leaving only the powdery
mineral matter behind. As heat and moisture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
are the conditions most conducive to the growth
of bacteria, and hence to decay, it would follow
that fine pearls should be kept in a dry cool
place when not in use.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXVIII</h2>

<h3>CULTURED PEARLS AND IMITATIONS OF PEARLS</h3>

<p><b>Cultured Pearls.</b> Like all very valuable
gems, pearls have stimulated the ingenuity of
man to attempt to make imitations that would
pass for genuine. Perhaps the most ingenious,
as well as the most natural looking product,
is the "<i>cultured pearl</i>." This is really natural
pearl on much of its exterior, but artificial
within and at the back. In order to bring
about this result the Japanese, who originated
the present commercial product, but who
probably borrowed the original idea from the
Chinese, call to their assistance the pearl oyster
itself. The oysters are gently opened, small
hemispherical discs of mother-of-pearl are introduced
between shell and mantle and the
oyster replanted. The foreign material is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
coated by the oyster with true pearly layers
as usual, and after several years a sufficiently
thick accumulation of pearly layers
is thus deposited on the nucleus so that the
oyster may be gathered and opened and the
cultured pearl removed by sawing it out from
the shell to which it has become attached. To
the base is then neatly cemented a piece of
mother-of-pearl to complete a nearly spherical
shape, and the portions of the surface that have
not been covered with true pearl are then
polished. The product, when set in a proper
pearl mounting, is quite convincing and really
beautiful.</p>

<p>As the time during which the oyster is
allowed to work upon the cultured pearl is
doubtless far less than is required for the
growth of a large natural pearl, the number
of layers of true pearly material is considerably
smaller than the number of layers
that take part in the multiple reflections
explained in the previous lesson, and hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the "orient" of the cultured pearl is never
equal to that of a fine true pearl. It is frequently
very good however, and for uses
that do not demand exposure of the whole
surface of the pearl, the cultured pearl supplies
a substitute for genuine pearls of moderate
quality and price. The back parts of the
cultured pearl, being only polished mother-of-pearl,
have the appearance of the ordinary pearl
button, rather than that of true pearl.</p>

<p><b>Imitations of Pearls.</b> Aside from these half
artificial cultured pearls, the out and out imitations
of pearls that have been most successfully
sold are of two general types, first "<i>Roman
pearls</i>," and, second, "<i>Indestructible pearls</i>."
The Roman pearls are made hollow and afterward
wax filled, the Indestructible pearls have
solid enamel bases. In both types the pearly
appearance is obtained by lining the interior,
or coating the exterior, with more or less numerous
layers of what is known as "<i>nacre</i>" or some
times as "<i>essence d'oriente</i>." This is prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
from the scales of a small fish found in the North
Sea and in Russia. The scales are removed and
treated with certain solutions which remove
the silvery powder from the scales. The "<i>nacre</i>"
is then prepared from this powder. The fineness
of the pearly effect becomes greater as
the preparation ages, so very fine imitations are
usually made from old "<i>nacre</i>." The effect is
also better the larger the number of successive
layers used. The artificial pearl thus resembles
the true pearl in the physical causes for the
beautiful effect.</p>

<p>In some cases the Roman pearl has a true
iridescence which is produced by "burning"
colors into the hollow enamel bead. Some of
the indestructible pearls are made over beads of
opalescent glass, thus imparting a finer effect
to the finished product. While the cheaper
grades of indestructible pearls have but three or
four layers of nacre, some of the fine ones have
as many as thirty or more. The earlier indestructible
pearls were made with a coating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
material which was easily affected by heat, or
by water, or by perspiration, as a gelatine-like
sizing was included in it. The more recent
product has a mineral binder which is not thus
affected, so that the "pearls" are really about as
durable as natural ones, and will at least last a
lifetime if used with proper care.</p>

<p>Like fine natural pearls, the fine imitations
should be wiped after use and carefully
put away. They should also be restrung
occasionally, as should real pearls both
to prevent loss by the breaking of the string
and because the string becomes soiled after a
time, and this hurts the appearance of the jewel.</p>

<p>The "Roman" type of imitation will not
stand much heat, as the wax core would melt
and run out.</p>

<p><b>Testing Imitations of Pearls.</b> As the making
of imitations of pearls is mainly hand-work
and as many treatments are required for
the best imitations, fairly high prices are
demanded for these better products, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
appearance and permanency warrant such
prices. The best imitation pearls are really
very difficult of detection except by close
examination. They will not, of course, stand
inspection under a high magnification.</p>

<p>Artificial pearls may also be detected by
their incorrect specific gravity, by their incorrect
degree of hardness, and in the case
of the hollow pearls by making a tiny ink
spot upon the surface of the "pearl" and
looking at it through a lens. A reflection
of the spot from the <i>inside</i> surface of the bead
will appear beside the spot itself if the pearl
is of the Roman type.</p>

<p>The artificial pearls so far described are
high class products. Some of the very cheap
and poor imitations are merely solid, or hollow,
glass or enamel beads which have been made
slightly pearly, either by adding various materials
to the glass or enamel when it was made,
or by crudely coating the beads without or
within with wax containing cheap "nacre."</p>

<h2>LESSON XXIX</h2>

<h3>THE USE OF BALANCES AND THE UNIT OF WEIGHT
IN USE FOR PRECIOUS STONES</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As</span> precious stones are almost always sold
by weight, and as the value at stake is
frequently very great, it is almost as necessary
for a gem merchant, as it is for the chemist,
to have delicate balances and to keep them in
good order and to use them skillfully.</p>

<p>A general understanding of the unit of
weight in use for precious stones and how
it is related to other standard weights is also
necessary to the gem dealer. We will therefore
consider in this lesson the use and care of
balances and the nature and relative value of
the unit of weight for precious stones.</p>

<p><b>Delicate Balances Needed.</b> As it is necessary,
on account of their great value, to weigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
some gems, such as diamonds, emeralds, rubies,
etc., with accuracy to at least the one hundredth
part of a carat (which is roughly in the neighborhood
of <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">15,000</span> of an ounce avoirdupois),
balances of very delicate and accurate
construction are a necessary part of the equipment
of every gem merchant. While portable
balances of a fair degree of accuracy are to be
had, the best and surest balances are substantially
constructed and housed in glass cases, much
as are those of the analytic chemist, which
must do even finer weighing. The case protects
the balance from dust and dirt and prevents
the action of air currents during the
weighing. The balance itself has very delicate
knife edges, sometimes of agate, sometimes
of hardened steel, and these knife edges rest,
when in use, on a block of agate or steel, so that
there is a minimum amount of friction. When
not in use the balance beam and knife edges
are lifted from the block and held firmly by a
metal arm, or else, as is the case with some balances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the post supporting the block is lowered,
leaving the beam and knife edges out of contact
with it. The object of this separation is
to prevent any rough contact between the knife
edges and the block on which they rest. Advantage
should always be taken of this device
whenever any fairly heavy load is put on or
taken off of either pan, as the sudden tipping
of the beam might chip the knife edges
if not supported. When the load is nearly
balanced there may be no harm in carefully
adding or removing small weights while the knife
edges are resting on the block, but even then it is
safer to lower the beam and pans. It should
be needless to state that as level and rigid a
support should be had for one's balance as
circumstances permit.</p>

<p><b>Method of Use of Balances.</b> Before using a
balance one should see that the pans are clean,
that the base of the balance is properly leveled
(the better balances have a spirit level attached)
and that the pans balance each other without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
load. When slightly out of balance the defect
may be adjusted by <i>unscrewing</i> the little adjusting
nut at the end of the beam that is too light,
or by <i>screwing in</i> the nut at the opposite end.
Having seen that the adjustment is perfect
the pans should be lowered and the object to be
weighed placed on the <i>left-hand pan</i> (because a
right-handed person will find it handier to
handle his weights on the right-hand pan).
One should next guess as nearly as possible the
weight of the stone and place well back on the
right-hand pan the weight that he thinks comes
nearest to that of the stone. If the weight is
too heavy the next lighter weight should replace
it. Smaller weights should be added
until a perfect balance is had, the small weights
being neatly arranged in the order of their size,
in order to more rapidly count them when the
stone is balanced. This is the case when the
pointer swings approximately equal distances
to the right and to the left and there is then no
need to wait for it to come to rest in the center.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to count the weights as they lie on
the pan (which is easily done if they have been
arranged in descending order of size as suggested
above) then write down the total, and on
removing the weights count aloud as they are
replaced in the box and note if the total checks
that which was written down. It may seem
unnecessary to be so careful in this matter, but
it is better to be over-careful than to make a
mistake where every hundredth of a carat
may mean from one to five or six dollars or more.
No dealer can afford to have a stone that he has
sold prove to be lighter than he has stated it to
be. One should be at least within one one-hundredth
of a carat of the correct weight.</p>

<p>It should be unnecessary to add that accurate
weights <i>should never be handled with the
fingers</i>. Ivory tipped forceps are best for
handling the weights. The forceps commonly
used for handling diamonds will, in time, wear
away the weights by scratching them so that
they will weigh materially less. Unless the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
weights are of platinum or plated with gold, the
perspiration of the hands would cause them to
oxidize and gain in weight. It would be well
to discard the smaller weights, which are most
in use, every few years and obtain new and
accurate ones. In case this is not done one
should at least have the weights checked
against others known to be of standard weight.
Any chemist will have balances and weights
far more accurate than the best in use for
precious stones and will gladly check the weights
of a gem dealer for a moderate fee.</p>

<p>To check the accuracy of your balance,
change the stone and weights to opposite pans,
in which case they should still balance.</p>

<p>One should never overload a balance, both
because the balance might be injured and
because the relative accuracy decreases as
the load increases. If the weight of a parcel
of stones heavier than the total of the weights
provided with the balance is desired, the parcel
should be divided and weighed in parts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>While many dealers neglect some of the precautions
above suggested and somehow get
along, yet it is safer to use care and to have correct
technique in the handling of one's balances.</p>

<p>Having indicated a few of the refinements of
method in weighing we will next consider the
unit of weight in use for precious stones and see
how it is related to other units of weight and in
what manner it is subdivided.</p>

<p><b>The Unit of Weight for Precious Stones.</b>
The present unit for precious stones in the
United States is the <i>metric carat</i>. Most
of the more progressive countries have in
recent years agreed upon the use of this unit.
Its use in the United States became general
July 1, 1913. It is by definition exactly one
fifth of a <i>gram</i> (the unit of weight of the <i>Metric
System</i> of weights and measures). Its relation
to the <i>grain</i> is that there are 3.08+ grains in the
metric carat. The carat in use in this country
up to a few years ago was about 2<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>% heavier
than the present metric carat. It was equal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
.2053 grams instead of .2000 grams (<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">5</span> gram).
The carats of countries not using the metric carat
vary considerably, but yet approximate the
metric carat somewhat nearly.</p>

<p>Thus, that in use in Great Britain was
.2053 g., in Amsterdam .2057 g., in Berlin
.20544 g., in Lisbon .20575 g., and in Florence
0.1972 g. The latter was the only one that
was under the metric carat. The change
to the metric carat was desirable, as it unified
the practice of weighing, which not only varied
in different countries, but even in the same
country. Thus there was no very exact agreement
among the makers of diamond weights
in the United States prior to the adoption of
the metric carat. One man's carat was a bit
heavier or lighter than another's. With a
definite and simple relationship to the standard
gram there is now no excuse for any variation
in weights. The Bureau of Standards at
Washington affords manufacturers every facility
for standardizing their weights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Decimal System of Subdivision of the
Carat.</b> With the adoption of the metric carat
the custom of expressing parts of a carat
in common fractions whose denominators
were powers of the number 2 (<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>, <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span>, <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">8</span>, <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">16</span>,
<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">32</span>, <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">64</span>) was discarded as awkward and slow
for computation and the decimal system of
subdivision was adopted. Thus the metric
carat is divided into tenths and one hundredths.
It is customary, however, to sum up
the one hundredths and express them as the
total number of one hundredths and not to express
them as tenths. Thus, a stone of 2.57
carats is said to weigh "two and fifty-seven
hundredths carats." The decimal system of
subdivision of the carat makes the figuring of
values simpler where no tables are handy.
Of course, new tables were at once prepared
when the new carat was adopted and they
afford a rapid means of ascertaining the value
of a stone of any weight when the price per carat
is known. Should it become necessary to convert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the weight of a stone from its expression in
the old system to that of the new, one need only
get 1.02<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>% of the old weight. (The old carat
was approximately .205 g., while the new one is
.200 g. Hence one old carat</p>

<div class="td6">
<table class="tb1" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td6" rowspan="2">is</td><td class="td9">.205</td><td class="td6" rowspan="2">=</td>
<td class="td9">.102<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span></td><td class="td6" rowspan="2">= 102<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>% of a new one.)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="td6">.200</td><td class="td6">.100</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><b>Method of Converting Weights.</b> If the old
weight has fractions these should first be
changed to decimals for convenience. For example,
suppose it is wished to change 2<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span> <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">16</span>
old carats to metric carats. <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;.25 and <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">16</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;.0625.
Hence 2<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span> <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">16</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.3125. Now get
102<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>% of this: (2.3125&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1.025&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.37 metric
carats).</p>

<p>If, for any reason one should need to change
from metric carats to old U. S. carats one should
multiply by .9756</p>

<div class="td6">
<table class="tb1" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td6" rowspan="2"><span class="sp1">(</span></td>
<td class="td9">.200 g.</td><td class="td6" rowspan="2">= .9756</td>
<td class="td6" rowspan="2"><span class="sp1">)</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="td7">.205 g.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>As was said in <a href="#LESSON_XXV">Lesson XXV.</a>, pearls are sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
by the <i>pearl grain</i>, which is arbitrarily fixed at
<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span> of a carat. With the change to the metric
carat the pearl grain was correspondingly
changed and its weight is now <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span> of .200 g.&nbsp;=&nbsp;.05 g.,
as expressed in the metric system.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXX</h2>

<h3>TARIFF LAWS ON PRECIOUS AND IMITATION STONES</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Since</span> it is necessary for a nation, as well as
for an individual, to have an income, and
since articles of luxury are more easily taxed
than are those of necessity, the traffic in gems
and their imitations has frequently been made a
source of revenue to our government. Usually
the per cent. charged as tariff has been comparatively
low, especially upon very valuable
gems, such as diamonds and pearls, for the
reason that too high a tariff would tend to tempt
unscrupulous dealers to smuggle such goods
into the country without declaring them. When
the margin of difference between the values,
with and without the tariff, is kept small the
temptation is but slight, when the danger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
detection and the drastic nature of the usual
punishment are taken into account. Rough
stones have frequently been allowed to enter
the country duty free because they were regarded
as desirable raw materials which would
afford employment to home industry.</p>

<p>The tariff laws of October 3, 1913, made,
however, some sweeping changes in the policy of
our government toward precious stones and as
those laws are still in force (April 4, 1917) this
lesson will attempt to set forth clearly the
exact conditions under the present law.</p>

<p>Perhaps the paragraph of first importance to
the trade is No. 357 which reads as follows.</p>

<p>"357. Diamonds and other precious stones,
rough or uncut, and not advanced in condition
or value from their natural state by cleaving,
splitting, cutting, or other process, whether
in their natural form or broken, and bort;
any of the foregoing not set, and diamond dust,
10 per centum ad valorem; pearls and parts
thereof, drilled or undrilled, but not set or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
strung; diamonds, coral, rubies, cameos, and
other precious stones and semi-precious stones,
cut but not set, and suitable for use in the
manufacture of jewelry, 20 per centum ad
valorem; imitation precious stones, including
pearls and parts thereof, for use in the manufacture
of jewelry, doublets, artificial, or so-called
synthetic or reconstructed, pearls and
parts thereof, rubies, or other precious stones,
20 per centum ad valorem."</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the chief changes over
the previous law are first that which imposes
a 10% duty on rough precious stones, which
were formerly free of duty, and second the
advance in the duty on cut diamonds and other
cut stones from the former 10% to the present
20%.</p>

<p>This increase in the tariff was regarded as
unwise by many conservative importers, as
the temptation to defraud the government is
made much greater than before. The change
was even feared by honest dealers who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
afraid that they could not successfully compete
with dishonest importers who might smuggle
gems into the country. In spite of a rather
determined opposition the change was made
and our most representative dealers have been
making the best of the situation and have been
doing all that they could to help prevent
smuggling or at least reduce it to a minimum.
Through their knowledge of the movements of
diamond stocks and of prices they are able to
detect any unduly large supply or any unwarranted
lowness of price and thus to assist the
government agents by directing investigation
towards any dealer who seems to be enjoying
immunity from the tariff.</p>

<p>The question of the status of Japanese cultured
pearls has been settled as follows. Paragraph
357 (quoted above) is ruled to cover
them and they are thus subject to a 20% ad
valorem tax.</p>

<p>Carbonadoes&mdash;miners' diamonds&mdash;are free of
duty, under paragraph 474. Crude minerals are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
also free of duty, paragraph 549. Paragraph
607 declares "Specimens of natural history
and mineralogy" are free.</p>

<p>In case the owner is not prepared to pay the
tax on imported merchandise the government
holds the goods for a period of three years pending
such payments.</p>

<p>In case an importer shows that imported
merchandise was purchased at more than
actual market value, he may deduct the difference
at time of entry and pay duty only on the
wholesale foreign market value, under Section
III., paragraph 1.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the examiner finds
merchandise to be undervalued on the invoice,
such merchandise is subject to additional penal
duties, but in case of disagreement between
the importer and the examiner as to the actual
market value, appeal may be taken to the
Customs Court.</p>

<p>Since the Philippine Islands are possessions
of the United States, pearls from those islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
may be admitted free of duty when the facts
of their origin are certified to.</p>

<p>In the case of precious stones which had their
origin in the United States, but which were
exported and kept for a time abroad it has been
ruled that such stones may be imported into the
United States free of duty.</p>

<p>When precious or imitation precious stones
are imported into the United States and subsequently
mounted into jewelry which is then
exported, the duty which was paid upon entry
may be refunded less a deduction of 1%.</p>

<p>The author wishes to extend his thanks to
Examiner W. B. Treadwell of New York, for his
assistance in regard to the subject dealt with
in this lesson.</p>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> student of gems will, of course, want to read
many books on the subject and the following
brief bibliography will enable the beginner to select
his reading wisely from the start. Much more complete
bibliographies will be found in some of the
books listed here, one which is notably complete to
date of publication is contained in <i>Diamonds and
Precious Stones</i>, by Harry Emanuel, F.R.G.S.,
London, John Camden Hotten, 1867. This covers
many languages.</p>

<p>The book which will probably be found most
useful by those who have mastered this little text
is the work by G. F. Herbert-Smith, to which frequent
reference has been made at the close of many
of our chapters. It is thoroughly scientific, yet
understandable, and is very complete on the scientific
side of the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gem-Stones</i>, G. F. Herbert-Smith, Jas. Pott &amp;
Co., N. Y.</p>

<p>For another work and one which contains information
of trade character as well as scientific
information about gems see <i>Precious Stones</i> by
W. R. Cattelle, J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., Phila., or see
<i>A Handbook of Precious Stones</i>, by M. D. Rothschild,
G. P. Putnam's Sons, N. Y.</p>

<p><i>Gems and Gem Minerals</i>, by Oliver Cummings
Farrington, A. W. Mumford, publisher, Chicago,
1903, is another good general work on gems. Its
color plates of rough gem minerals are especially
good.</p>

<p>Those who are especially interested in the diamond
should see <i>The Diamond</i> by W. R. Cattelle,
The John Lane Co., N. Y., which gives a good account
of its subject and is rich in commercial information,
or <i>Diamonds: A Study of the Factors
which Govern their Value</i>, by the present author,
G. P. Putnam's Sons, N. Y., 1914.</p>

<p>Sir Wm. Crook's, the <i>Diamond</i>, Harper &amp; Bros.,
N. Y., is very interesting, especially in its account
of the author's visits to the S. African mines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Students of pearls will find <i>The Book of the Pearl</i>,
by Dr. Geo. F. Kunz and Dr. Chas. Stevenson,
Century Co., N. Y., very complete. A smaller
work, yet a good one, on pearls is <i>The Pearl</i> by
W. R. Cattelle, J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., Phila.,
1907. This book is strong on the commercial
side.</p>

<p>An older work is <i>Pearls and Pearling</i> by D. Edwin
Streeter, Geo. Bell &amp; Co., London.</p>

<p>A work on gems and gem-cutting by a practical
cutter is <i>The Gem Cutter's Craft</i>, by Leopold Claremont,
Geo. Bell &amp; Sons, London, but it should be
said that very few trade secrets will be found exposed
in the book.</p>

<p>On the subject of scientific precious stones <i>The
Production and Identification of Artificial Precious
Stones</i>, by Noel Heaton, B.Sc., F.C.S., read before
the Royal Society of Arts, Apr. 26, 1911, is very
fine. It may be had in the annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution for 1911, p. 217. It gives
one of the best accounts to be had of the history
of the artificial production of precious stones, especially
of the corundum gems. It also contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
a splendid account of how to distinguish scientific
from natural gems.</p>

<p>Most students of gems will need to refer frequently
to some good text-book of mineralogy.
Although old, Dana's <i>Mineralogy</i> is still a standard
work. A newer book and one of a more popular
nature is L. P. Gratacap's <i>The Popular Guide to
Minerals</i>, D. Van Nostrand &amp; Co., N. Y.</p>

<p>Among larger and more expensive books on gems
may be mentioned <i>Precious Stones</i>, by Dr. Max
Bauer. This is an English translation of a German
work which is a classic in its field. As it is now out
of print in its English edition, a somewhat detailed
account of its character may be of value to those
who may be inclined to go to the effort to seek a
copy at a public library or perhaps to purchase one
through second-hand book stores.</p>

<p>A popular account of their characters, occurrence
and applications, with an introduction to their
determination, for mineralogists, lapidaries, jewelers,
etc., with an appendix on pearls and coral, by
Dr. Max Bauer, Privy Councillor, professor in the
Union of Marburg. Translated from the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
by L. J. Spencer, M.A. (Cantab.), F.G.S., assistant
in the mineral department of the British Museum.
With twenty plates and ninety-four figures in the
text. London, Chas. Griffin &amp; Co., Ltd.: Phila.,
J. B. Lippincott Co., 1904.</p>

<p>The book is a large one, xv + 627 pages, and is
divided into three parts with an appendix on pearls
and coral.</p>

<p>Part I. deals with the general characters of precious
stones.</p>

<ul><li>1. Natural characters and occurrence.</li>

<li>2. Applications of Precious Stones.</li>

<li>3. Classification of Precious Stones. 106 pages.</li></ul>

<p>Part II. Systematic Description of Precious
Stones, Diamond, Corundum Gems, Spinel, etc.
450 pages.</p>

<p>Part III. Determination and Distinguishing of
Precious Stones. 20 pages.</p>

<p>Appendix, 26 pages. Pearls and Coral.</p>

<p>Bauer is exhaustive in his descriptions of the
more important precious stones and he also describes
briefly very many little known and little
used gem minerals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>On forms of cutting he is old-fashioned.</p>

<p>First 68 pages given to explanation of characters
used in identifying stones. Good.</p>

<p>On the Process of Cutting. Pages 79-87. Good
account. More practical than most books give.</p>

<p>Careful accounts of occurrence of precious stones
with maps.</p>

<p>Character of the occurrence of diamond in India,
Brazil, and Africa, quite in detail.</p>

<p>The student who wishes to master the subject
of gems cannot afford to neglect Bauer.</p>

<p>For those who read French, the latest, the most
complete and thorough book on gems is Jean Escard's
<i>Les Pierres Pr&eacute;cieuses</i>, H. Dunod et E. Pinat,
Paris, 1914.</p>

<p>It is a large and finely illustrated work.</p>

<p>The author has really outdone Bauer. The
detail in regard to diamonds especially is very fine.
Even the use of diamonds in mechanical ways is
very completely gone into and also details in regard
to cutting diamonds are very completely given.
It is to be hoped that an English translation will
soon become available.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Another large and thoroughgoing work is
Gardner F. Williams' <i>The Diamond Mines of South
Africa</i>, MacMillan, N. Y.</p>

<p>Dr. Geo. F. Kunz's <i>Gems and Precious Stones
of North America</i>, The Sci. Pub. Co., N. Y., 1890,
336 pages, 8 colored plates (excellent ones too),
many engravings, is a very complete account of all
published finds of precious stones in the United
States, Canada, and Mexico, giving a popular description
of their value, history, archeology, and of
the collections in which they exist, also a chapter
on pearls and on remarkable foreign gems owned
in the United States. Many rare and little known
semi-precious stones are described here. Dr. Kunz
is also the author of several more recent gem books
notably <i>The Magic of Jewels and Charms</i> and <i>The
Curious Lore of Precious Stones</i>, Lippincott, Phila.</p>

<p>Among books on engraved gems is the old <i>Hand
Book of Gem Engraving</i> by C. W. King; Bell &amp;
Daldy, London, 1866, and one by Duffield Osborne;
Henry Holt &amp; Co., N. Y. Another book on this
subject is <i>Engraved Gems</i> by Maxwell Somerville;
Drexel Biddle, Phila.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>For those who wish still further references the
following older works will prove interesting.</p>

<p><i>Precious Stones</i>, by W. R. Cattelle; Lippincott,
Phila. <i>Precious Stones</i>, by W. Goodchild; D. Van
Nostrand &amp; Co., N. Y.</p>

<p>Julius Wodiska, of New York, has also written
an interesting work on precious stones, <i>A Book of
Precious Stones</i>, Putnam's, 1907.</p>

<p>Still older works are <i>Precious Stones and Gems</i> by
Edwin W. Streeter; Chapman &amp; Hall, London,
1877. This is a book of 264 pages with nine illustrations.
It contains much of value and was unsurpassed
in its day. Its first-hand accounts of
numerous important, even celebrated diamonds and
other precious stones will always make it valuable
to the student of gems.</p>

<p>Another book by the same author is <i>The Great
Diamonds of the World</i>; Geo. Bell &amp; Sons, London,
1882; 321 pages. Not illustrated. Its title adequately
describes its contents. It is an excellent
work. The author even traveled in India tracing
the history of some of the famous diamonds that
he describes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Diamonds and Precious Stones</i>, by Louis Dieulafait
published in its English translation by Scribner,
Armstrong &amp; Co., N. Y., 1874, is another old but
interesting work. It has 292 pages and 126 engravings
on wood. It gives a fine account of diamond
cutting as practiced at that time. There is also
an excellent history of the production of artificial
precious stones to that date.</p>

<p><i>The Natural History of Precious Stones and of
the Precious Metals</i> by C. W. King, M.A., Bell &amp;
Daldy, London, 1870, is rich in references to
classical literature.</p>

<p>One or two interesting monographs on precious
stones have been written and <i>The Tourmaline</i>, by
Augustus C. Hamlin is one of these. Mr. Hamlin
became interested in gems because of his accidental
discovery of some of the fine tourmalines of Maine.
His <i>Leisure Hours among the Gems</i> is also very
readable. Jas. R. Osgood &amp; Co., Boston, 1884. It
deals especially with diamond, emerald, opal, and
sapphire. He gives a good account of American
finds of diamond, and a long account of European
regalia. The book is full of interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
comment and contains many references to older
authors.</p>

<p><i>The Tears of the Heliades</i> or <i>Amber as a Gem</i>, by
W. Arnold Buffum, G. P. Putnam's Sons, N. Y.,
1900, is as its name implies a monograph on amber.</p>

<p>A good work on the history of precious stones and
on historical-jewels is <i>Gems and Jewels</i> by Madame
de Barrera; Richard Bentley, London, 1860. It
deals also with the geography of gem sources.
An interesting chapter on "Great Jewel Robberies"
is also included.</p>

<p>Of still greater age but of great interest is John
Mawe's old work, on diamonds and precious stones.
In it the author discusses in a conversational style
that is very attractive much of the gem lore of his
day and shows a profound knowledge of his subject,
a knowledge that was evidently first hand and practical,
<i>A Treatise on Diamonds and Precious Stones</i>,
by John Mawe, London. 2nd edition. Printed for
and sold by the author.</p>

<p>For readers of French, Jean Baptiste Tavernier's
<i>Voyages</i>, in six volumes, will be vastly interesting.
Tavernier made six journeys to India and the East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
between 1640 and 1680 as a gem merchant during
which time he purchased and brought back to
Europe many celebrated gems including the famous
French blue diamond which he sold to Louis XIV.
and which was stolen at the robbery of the Garde
Meuble during the French Revolution. Tavernier
describes these famous stones and many others that
he was privileged to inspect in the treasuries of the
Grand Mogul. He also describes interestingly and
at great length the curious manners and customs
of the people of the East. <i>Les Six Voyages de
Jean Baptiste Tavernier</i>, etc., Nouvelle edition,
Rouen, 1724.</p>

<p>Pliny's <i>Natural History</i>, to go much further back,
is full of references to gems, and gem students
should run through it (it is to be had in English
translation) for such interesting bits as that in
which he describes the belief that quartz crystal
results from the effect of very great cold upon ice,
a belief which Pliny himself is careful not to subscribe
to. He contents himself with relating what
others believe in this regard.</p>

<p>Both the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
afford many references to gems with which the
eager student of the subject should be familiar.
"She is more precious than rubies" (referring to
wisdom) is but one of these.</p>

<p>In conclusion the author hopes that this little
text may lead a few to pursue further this most
fascinating theme and that the pursuit may bring
much of pleasure as well as of profit.</p>

<p class="hd2"><b><big>The Identification of Gems and Gem Minerals and an
Account of Their Scientific, Commercial,
Artistic, and Historical Aspects</big></b></p>

<p class="hd1"><b><big>By Julius Wodiska</big></b><br />
<small><i>8vo. With 33 Full-page Illustrations and 4 Colored Plates</i></small></p>

<p><small>A description, in altogether a new fashion, of gems and gem
minerals, their nature and history, comprehensible to every reader,
and of prime value to students and to jewelers.</small></p>

<p><small>The general reader will enjoy the simple descriptions of the
origin, development, and treatment of the diamond, sapphire, and
other precious stones, as well as of the beautiful semi-precious
stones. Just enough of the technical has been provided to make
the new gem book a <i>vade mecum</i> for students of gem minerals
and for the army of jewelers in the United States, as well as
their fellow-craftsmen and merchants in all English-speaking
places. The art and industry of mounting gems is somewhat
elaborately covered, especially as exemplified in the work of
students at technical schools and the many unattached workers in
jewelry designing and making who form a part of the Arts and
Crafts movement. Some of the quaint superstitions about gems
in the chapter on folklore have a curious interest. The author
takes cognizance of the public desire nowadays for the novel and
uncommon in gems, and shows that prospectors, gem miners, mineralogists,
and jewelers are co-operating to greatly lengthen the
lists of popular semi-precious stones. A chapter is devoted to
collections of gems in museums.</small></p></div>
